      "Individuals establish a household budget in an effort to understand their cash flow- how much they make and how much they spend. A budget is a tool that can help individuals plan for desired purchases and establish savings for reaching financial goals. Budgets are often essential for people who desire to keep spending under control. For individuals approaching retirement tracking income and expenses can help determine the needed income required for retirement planning.\nA budget can be descriptive, in that it simply tracks a household's cash flows[note 1] or prescriptive, in which a plan of future spending is budgeted, and income and spending is controlled in an attempt to track the proposed budget.\nPerhaps the most important idea underlying the Bogleheads approach to investing is recognizing you need to save a significant portion of income every month to have enough money for a comfortable retirement. There is no substitute for spending less than you earn.\nThe Bogleheads approach to developing a workable financial plan is to have a sensible household budget - one that provides for needed expenditures, discretionary pleasures, savings for big ticket items, and savings for long term retirement planning. Avoid excess debt, such as credit cards and home equity loans. If you have such debt, pay off those balances first. Reduce expenses and unneeded debt so you can consistently set aside a portion of earnings for decades. If you don't save enough, no amount of financial trickery will provide the returns needed for a comfortable retirement.\nBudget worksheets are available from many sources; choose a format that you are comfortable with. The example below illustrates the process.\nRecord your income in the left column. As you can see from the example below, there are spaces on your worksheet for other incomes sources that might fit your personal situation. As you record your income, be sure to consider whether income sources are continuous or whether they might stop in the near future. For example, if your receive unemployment benefits, keep in mind when you will stop receiving these benefits.\nYou also might want to make adjustments for income you receive on a yearly or quarterly basis, such as tax refunds or bonus checks.\nCalculate your total income by adding the numbers in the left column. This number represents the amount of income you receive in a month.\nNext, list your monthly expenses in the right-hand column.\nBegin by listing your fixed expenses. Fixed expenses are items you have little or no control over. You will pay a fixed amount for these expenses each month.\nThe next group is flexible expenses, which are expenses that you can control. When thinking about flexible expenses, think about what you need and what you want. This will help you to control your spending in this category. What are some ways that you could control the costs of these expenses?\nAlso, make sure to pay yourself first. Set aside money from each paycheck and put it towards your savings. You will notice in the example below that “savings” is listed as an expense.\nCalculate your total expenses by adding the numbers in the right column. This number represents the amount of expenses you spend in a month.\nNow, compare your Total Income (left column) against Total Expenses (right column). If your income is more than your expenses, you are spending less than you earn and are on the right path to live below your means.\nOtherwise, you should replan your budget and reconsider whether or not you are ready to invest.",

      "Budgeting 101: How to Budget Money Divide your income among needs, wants, savings and debt repayment, using the 50/30/20 budget. If I have take-home pay of, say, $2,000 a month, how can I pay for housing, food, insurance, health care, debt repayment and fun without running out of money? That’s a lot to cover with a limited amount, and this is a zero-sum game. The answer is to make a budget. What is a budget? A budget is a plan for every dollar you have. It’s not magic, but it represents more financial freedom and a life with much less stress. Here’s how to set up and then manage your budget. How to budget money Calculate your monthly income, pick a budgeting method and monitor your progress. Try the 50/30/20 rule as a simple budgeting framework. Allow up to 50% of your income for needs. Leave 30% of your income for wants. Commit 20% of your income to savings and debt repayment. Track and manage your budget through regular check-ins. Understand the budgeting process Figure out your after-tax income: If you get a regular paycheck, the amount you receive is probably it, but if you have automatic deductions for a 401(k), savings, and health and life insurance, add those back in to give yourself a true picture of your savings and expenditures. If you have other types of income — perhaps you make money from side gigs — subtract anything that reduces it, such as taxes and business expenses. Choose a budgeting plan: Any budget must cover all of your needs, some of your wants and — this is key — savings for emergencies and the future. Budgeting plan examples include the envelope system and the zero-based budget. Track your progress: Record your spending or use online budgeting and savings tools. Automate your savings: Automate as much as possible so the money you’ve allocated for a specific purpose gets there with minimal effort on your part. An accountability partner or online support group can help, so that you're held accountable for choices that blow the budget. Practice budget management: Your income, expenses and priorities will change over time, so actively manage your budget by revisiting it regularly, perhaps once a quarter. If you're struggling to stick with your plan, try these budgeting tips. Frequently asked questions How do you make a budget spreadsheet? Start by determining your take-home (net) income, then take a pulse on your current spending. Finally, apply the 50/30/20 rule: 50% toward needs, 30% toward wants and 20% toward savings and debt repayment. How do you keep a budget? The key to keeping a budget is to track your spending on a regular basis so you can get an accurate picture of where your money is going and where you’d like it to go instead. Here’s how to get started: 1. Check your account statements and categorize your expenses. 2. Keep your tracking consistent. 3. Identify room for change. Free online spreadsheets and templates can make budgeting easier. How do you figure out a budget? Start with a financial self-assessment. Once you know where you stand and what you hope to accomplish, pick a budgeting system that works for you. We recommend the 50/30/20 system, which splits your income across three major categories: 50% goes to necessities, 30% to wants and 20% to savings and debt repayment. Try a simple budgeting plan We recommend the popular 50/30/20 budget to maximize your money. In it, you spend roughly 50% of your after-tax dollars on necessities, no more than 30% on wants, and at least 20% on savings and debt repayment. We like the simplicity of this plan. Over the long term, someone who follows these guidelines will have manageable debt, room to indulge occasionally, and savings to pay irregular or unexpected expenses and retire comfortably. Allow up to 50% of your income for needs Your needs — about 50% of your after-tax income — should include: Groceries. Housing. Basic utilities. Transportation. Insurance. Minimum loan payments. Anything beyond the minimum goes into the savings and debt repayment category. Child care or other expenses you need so you can work. If your absolute essentials overshoot the 50% mark, you may need to dip into the “wants” portion of your budget for a while. It’s not the end of the world, but you'll have to adjust your spending. Even if your necessities fall under the 50% cap, revisiting these fixed expenses occasionally is smart. You may find a better cell phone plan, an opportunity to refinance your mortgage or an opportunity for less expensive car insurance. That leaves you more to work with elsewhere. Leave 30% of your income for wants Separating wants from needs can be difficult. In general, though, needs are essential for you to live and work. Typical wants include dinners out, gifts, travel and entertainment. It’s not always easy to decide. Are restorative spa visits (including tips for a massage) a want or a need? How about organic groceries? Decisions vary from person to person. If you're eager to get out of debt as fast as you can, you may decide your wants can wait until you have some savings or your debts are under control. But your budget shouldn't be so austere that you can never buy anything just for fun. Every budget needs wiggle room — maybe you forgot about an expense or one was bigger than you anticipated — and some money to spend as you wish. If there's no money for fun, you'll be less likely to stick with your budget. Commit 20% of your income to savings and debt repayment Use 20% of your after-tax income to put something away for the unexpected, save for the future and pay off debt. Make sure you think of the bigger financial picture; that may mean two-stepping between savings and debt repayment to accomplish your most pressing goals. Priority No. 1 is a starter emergency fund. Many experts recommend you try to build up several months of bare-bones living expenses. We suggest you start with an emergency fund of at least $500 — enough to cover small emergencies and repairs — and build from there. You can’t get out of debt without a way to avoid more debt every time something unexpected happens. And you’ll sleep better knowing you have a financial cushion. Priority No. 2 is getting the employer match on your 401(k). Get the easy money first. For most people, that means tax-advantaged accounts such as a 401(k). If your employer offers a match, contribute at least enough to grab the maximum. It's free money. Why do we make capturing an employer match a higher priority than debts? Because you won’t get another chance this big at free money, tax breaks and compound interest. Ultimately, you have a better shot at building wealth by getting in the habit of regular long-term savings. You don’t get a second chance at capturing the power of compound interest. Every $1,000 you don’t put away when you’re in your 20s could be $20,000 less you have at retirement. Priority No. 3 is toxic debt. Once you’ve snagged a match on a 401(k), if available, go after the toxic debt in your life: high-interest credit card debt, personal and payday loans, title loans and rent-to-own payments. All carry interest rates so high that you end up repaying two or three times what you borrowed. If either of the following situations applies to you, investigate options for debt relief, which can include bankruptcy or debt management plans: You can't repay your unsecured debt — credit cards, medical bills, personal loans — within five years, even with drastic spending cuts. Your total unsecured debt equals half or more of your gross income. Priority No. 4 is, again, saving for retirement. Once you’ve knocked off any toxic debt, the next task is to get yourself on track for retirement. Aim to save 15% of your gross income; that includes your company match, if there is one.  If you’re young, consider funding a Roth individual retirement account after you capture the company match. Once you hit the contribution limit on the IRA, return to your 401(k) and maximize your contribution there. Priority No. 5 is, again, your emergency fund. Regular contributions can help you build up three to six months' worth of living expenses. You shouldn’t expect steady progress because emergencies happen, and that's when you should pull money from this fund. Just focus on replacing what you use and building higher over time.  Priority No. 6 is debt repayment. These are payments beyond the minimum required to pay off your remaining debt. If you’ve already paid off your most toxic debt, what’s left is probably lower-rate, often tax-deductible debt (such as your mortgage). Tackle these when the more-basic goals listed above are covered.  Any wiggle room you have here comes from the money available for wants or from saving on your necessities, not your emergency fund and retirement savings. Priority No. 7 is you. Congratulations! You’re in a great position — a really great position — if you’ve built an emergency fund, paid off toxic debt and are socking away 15% toward a retirement nest egg. You’ve built a habit of saving that gives you immense financial flexibility. Don’t give up now. Consider saving for irregular expenses that aren’t emergencies, such as a new roof or your next car. Those expenses will come no matter what, and it’s better to save for them than borrow.",

      "Although it may seem daunting, working out how to budget your money doesn’t need to be hard. With these practical budgeting tips, saving up for your short- and long-term goals can almost seem effortless. And these tips aren’t just for those with a ton of disposable income. If you’re wondering how to budget money on low income, we’ve got you covered with smart methods such as the 50/30/20 budget rule.\nRead on to learn about five of our favorite tried-and-true budgeting tips.\n1. Don’t ask how to budget money—ask why you want to budget\nIt may sound simple, but the first step to creating a budget is to determine exactly why you want to start saving money.\nThe key to success in any endeavor is to create specific, yet challenging objectives. Understanding what motivates you to save can go a long way toward creating clear, achievable savings targets. And keeping your savings goals in mind can help you to stay focused and on track, even when things aren’t so easy.\nHere are three questions you might want to ask yourself before making your budget:\nWhat is important to you? For example, do you live to travel? Do you dream of becoming a homeowner? Or would you like to save up for studying?\nWhat is a realistic, yet challenging, goal that you want to save for?\nIs this goal motivating enough that you will want to stick with it, even if there are periods in which saving becomes a little tricky?\n2. Distinguish between short-term savings goals and long-term saving goals\nOnce you’ve asked yourself why you want to start saving, the next step in building a budget is to divide your savings goals into short- and long-term plans.\nWhat is a short-term savings goal? These relatively modest targets may include the following:\nA nice piece of furniture\nA weekend vacation\nA down payment on a car\nAn emergency fund\nLong-term savings goals might look like:\nA deposit for a flat or a house\nPaying off any long-standing debt\nStarting up your own business\nA trip around the world\nSaving for retirement\nHaving a combination of both short- and long-term saving goals can make the larger goals seem less intimidating. As you gradually achieve your short-term goals, you may realize how possible it is to save money and be in control of your finances. And this can make your long-term goals feel increasingly attainable.\nHow to budget money realistically\nBefore starting your budget, consider whether your short- and long-term savings goals are realistic. There’s nothing more demotivating than setting an idealized, yet totally unattainable goal and watching it become increasingly impossible to achieve.\nA fantastic personal budgeting tip is to follow psychologist Edwin Locke’s SMART goal-setting method. SMART stands for: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound. As long as your budgeting goals adhere to each and every one of these five descriptions, they’re realistic enough for you to start your budget.\n3. Track your spending to create a solid budget\nIf you want to start budgeting effectively, you need to understand exactly how much is coming in and out of your account every month.\nThe best way to do this is to track all of your income and expenses over a 30-day period. This means being aware of every single transaction and either noting it down in a spreadsheet or using a budgeting app such as You Need a Budget.\n4. Separate fixed expenses from variable expenses\nOnce you’ve got a good overview of where all your money is coming and going each month, the next step is to separate your expenditures into fixed and variable costs.\nThe category of fixed costs may include:\nMonthly rent\nHeating and electricity bills\nInsurance costs (i.e. car, personal liability or property)\nStudent loan repayments\nVariable costs, which may change monthly or even weekly, include:\nGrocery shopping\nEntertainment (i.e. nights out, cinema trips, concerts)\nClothes shopping\nEating out\nPersonal budgeting tips for reducing your variable costs\nWhile your fixed costs do not offer you much—if any—flexibility with regards to saving, your variable costs do. This doesn’t mean that you have to stop going out and having fun. It just means building everyday habits to help you save a bit more.\nHere are some budgeting tips you might want to consider to lower your variable costs:\nPrep your meals at home instead of going out for lunch at work.\nConsider if you really need to upgrade your phone to the latest model if your current model is working just fine.\nChoose one day a week where you don’t spend anything on variable costs.\nAdopt the save now, spend later technique. This means setting aside your money for your savings goals and fixed costs at the beginning of the month and only using the remaining balance to pay for your monthly variable costs.\n5. Plan a monthly budget\nSo, you’ve worked out why you want to budget, what you want to save for, and what your fixed and variable costs are. Now it’s time to work out how to save money each month.\nOf course, this varies dramatically from person to person. You may be a freelancer with variable income or a full-time employee with a steady paycheck. Or maybe you’re trying to stretch every last dollar to save on low income. Whatever the case may be, we’ve compiled some smart budgeting tips that can work with any level of income.\nThe 50/20/30 rule\nThe 50/30/20 rule encourages your budget to look as follows:\n50% of your income goes towards your “needs,” i.e. your fixed costs such as rent and bills.\n30% is allocated to your “wants,” i.e. your variable costs such as eating out, trips to the hairdresser and clothes shopping.\n20% goes into your savings or towards paying off debt.\nThe 50/30/20 rule was actually created by US senator Elizabeth Warren, a bankruptcy specialist at Harvard, as a way to show American citizens how to budget and save money and how to budget money on a low income.\nIf you decide to opt for the 50/30/20 method, consider automating your expenses each month. This means that your income is automatically divided at the beginning of the month in accordance with the 50/30/20 rule. By doing this, you’ll only be left with the 30% allocated to “wants” in your bank account, which you can then spend during the month without worrying about whether you are overspending or not meeting your budgeting goals.\nThe zero-based budget\nThe zero-based budgeting method differs slightly from the 50/30/20 approach in that it looks at assigning each penny a specific job. At the end of the month, all income minus all expenditures should equal zero; there should be no left-over money in your account.\nThis means fine-tuning your budget so that you know exactly how much you are spending on your fixed, variable and savings costs each month, to the cent. This is a very detail-orientated approach to budgeting, and means that you need to be acutely aware of all of your monthly transactions as they happen.\nCreate a budgeting contingency plan\nLife always comes with a few surprises, so it’s a good idea to have a budgeting contingency plan for when things get a little complicated. One of the best budgeting tips is to prepare for when you may not be able to stick so closely to your plan. This stops you from becoming demotivated and losing track of your budgeting goals completely.\nHere are some tips for creating a contingency plan:\nFactor in saving for an emergency fund as part of your budget. This could mean saving five percent of your income every month for those unforeseeable circumstances.\nCreate a fallback budget which you refer to in an emergency. This budget cuts out everything that isn’t essential for everyday life, i.e. variable costs. This frees up some money to use in an emergency.\nSources: expertprogrammanagement(Locke’s SMART method) Goal-Setting Theory of Motivation by Fred C. Lunenburg",

      "8 Steps To An Organized Financial Life A lack of organization can harm your finances as much as being short on cash. Losing bills will lead to late fees, and not keeping track of your checking account balance can lead to overdraft fees. The following steps will help you stay on top of your financial life and save you money in the long run. Review Your Budget Monthly Even regular bills can change from month to month. Revise your budget as the bills come in and adjust other expenses to make up for it so that you don't accidentally overdraw your bank account. KEY TAKEAWAYS Even routine expenses like utility bills go up or down from month to month. Keep track of them and adjust your discretionary spending accordingly. Keep a checklist of monthly bills to avoid unpleasant surprises. Coordinate day-to-day spending with significant others. Some months bring higher electrical bills than others. Your electricity bill could be $100 more in June than it was in May. Your budget needs to reflect that higher expense. Review it to see what other expenses you can adjust so you can pay your electric bill. And remember, July is going to be hotter than June, so your revised budget will be more realistic going forward. Adjust as Needed To save $100, you might exchange two dinners out for a bike ride with a packed lunch. Or, dial down a budgeted night out and go to a free concert in the park instead of a pricey restaurant. Basic budgeting apps can be found online for free. The best part about having to cut down on one expense to pay for another is that it will force you to break tradition and try something new. What if you don't have a budget? Create one today. Start by writing down your expenses the way you expect them to unfold. At the end of the month, tweak the budget by recording your real expenses. That process alone could surprise you and suggest ways you can use your money smarter. Use a Financial App Financial software isn't just for investing. Free basic budgeting apps are available online that can help you keep track of daily and household expenses. When choosing a budgeting app, check the app store ratings or verify on the Better Business Bureau website that the one you're considering has a good track record with customers.     Keep Bills in One Place Even if most of your bills arrive electronically, you still need a place for those that come by mail. And yes, some still do. Property tax and homeowners' insurance bills typically are paid on an annual or quarterly basis, so they generally arrive by mail. An occasional expense like a medical test may be billed the old-fashioned way. Keep the bills near your desk or wherever you normally write checks or pay bills online. A simple file cabinet or a couple of folders will do the job. Now that most people take care of bills online, it's common to shred any paper statements that arrive and rely on online records. If you prefer to keep paper records for tax purposes or just for security, file them in the filing system you just bought or scan them for storage in an online filing system. Pay Bills the Day You Get Them If you have money available in your bank account and you don't have other debit card or bill pay charges coming through that could cause an overdraft, pay your bills as soon as you get them. Pay attention to paper bills that you usually pay electronically. You don't want to pay a bill twice because you got a duplicate by mail. Always call the creditor when a paper bill arrives if you think you have an automatic payment scheduled or electronic billing set up. Use a Checklist for Bills You're Expecting Neither mail nor email is perfect. Create a checklist at the beginning of the month listing every bill you are expecting. You can keep it on your desk, bill-paying area or a file on your computer. Coordinate with Significant Others If you share expenses with a spouse or significant other, you can easily bounce a check or debit card payment if you don't know how much the other has been spending. Say your spouse has the day off and decides to have lunch and go golfing with a buddy. When you get home, you hear about a great game of golf. What you don't hear is that it cost $150 and your direct-debited student loan payment is about to bounce. Verify that Your Paycheck is Direct Deposited If you have direct deposit you get used to your paycheck being there on paydays. However, electronic payments aren't always recorded on the expected date. Don't spend your paycheck without confirming that it's there. Use Two Bank Accounts Use one account for discretionary spending and saving, and the other for paying bills. That will prevent you from accidentally spending the rent money on a night out. It's Easy Missing bill payments because of a lack of organization is the easiest financial problem to fix. You don't have to follow all eight of these tips, but make sure you have an organizational system that you can stick to every month.",

      "Having an emergency fund is a necessity. Think of it as a shock absorber for the bumps of life, one that’ll keep you from adding to the load of debt you most likely already carry. The coronavirus outbreak has shone a giant spotlight on the difference having an emergency fund makes when a crisis hits.\nRead on for details on how to build an emergency fund and just how much you’ll need to save for it.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nAn emergency fund is a key component of any good financial plan.\nThe rule of thumb is that you need to keep between three and six months’ worth of household expenses in your emergency fund.\nIn order to populate your fund, you should find ways to economize and contribute those savings—along with any financial windfalls—to it.\nWhile some call having one to two months’ wages in reserve ideal, most financial experts say that the recommended emergency fund amount should cover three to six months’ worth of household expenses. That’s a great idea, and a key part of any sound financial plan, but it also requires some effort to achieve.\nThe first step in the process is to figure out how much you spend each month. Consumer expenditure figures released in April 2019 by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that the average annual expenditure per consumer unit, which is similar to a household, was $60,060 in 2017 (the most recent year for which data is available). This data is broken down by month in the table below. The months in bold highlight the cumulative quarterly expenses, and therefore, the recommended cash reserve for the average household.\nWhile your household expenses may be higher or lower than the average, there’s no doubt that even three months’ worth of expenses is a big number. One look at that number and the average person’s first reaction is, “I can’t come up with that kind of money.”\nThe amount of money required to populate a proper emergency fund is certainly significant, but we live in uncertain times with uncertain economies, especially in the wake of the coronavirus. Corporate loyalty is a thing of the past, and unemployment can happen unexpectedly, usually at the worst possible moment. Even without a global crisis, emergencies such as sudden illness or disability, major car repairs or a new roof, can be expensive, and there’s never a good time for these things to happen.\nWhile it’s probably true that you don’t have an extra $15,015 lying around, everything is relative. Even six months’ worth of expenses is a puny number compared to the amount you will need to save for retirement, and there’s not a savvy investor out there who balks at the idea of stashing away so much money that they will never need to work again. When compared to what you’ll need over the course of 20 or 30 years in retirement, three months’ worth of expenses doesn’t look like much.\nThough the amount of money needed in your fund may seem daunting at first, remember that it is a drop in the bucket compared with the amount you will have to save for retirement.\nWith that perspective in mind, let’s consider how to save for an emergency fund. Approach this effort the same way you would approach any other financial goal. Put together a plan and execute it. The first step is to determine how much you spend each month. Housing, transportation, and food will likely be the categories that eat up most of your cash. The average household spends 62% of its income, which averages $73,573 before taxes, on these items, according to the BLS Consumer Expenditures report.\nOnce you know your total expenses for each month, multiply that number by three. Reaching that number will be your initial goal. To achieve your three-month target, you need to start saving money.\nIf we assume your initial goal is $10,000, the table below illustrates how much you will need to save each month, over a five-year or two-and-a-half-year period.\nBuying a less expensive car the next time you are shopping for an auto and downgrading your cell phone service are two easy ways to come up with some cash to fund your savings plan. Skipping that two-week vacation, cutting down on the amount you spend dining out, and saving your next raise or bonus are also achievable methods of adding to your emergency fund.\nThe key is to add to the fund at regular intervals. Ideally, you should treat it like any other recurring bill you must pay each month. Dedicate the appropriate amount from your paycheck and set it aside. While most people have no qualms about regularly sending enormous amounts of money to credit card companies, they balk at the idea of paying themselves first. Change that equation.\nIf you are among the many investors who don’t have a rainy day fund stashed away in case of emergencies, there’s no time like the present to start saving. Even if you don’t have the fortitude to address the project with a dedicated savings program, you can start simple: Take the change out of your pockets at the end of the day and put it in a jar. Look into micro-investing platforms, such as Acorns, that round up purchases made from linked accounts and collect and invest the change.\nYou could also eat at home instead of dining out and “tip” yourself by adding a few bucks to your emergency fund. If you get cash back on your credit cards or just paid off a big debt, such as a personal loan or an automobile, put that newfound money into your fund. If you get a tax refund, deposit the check into your fund. If you manage to dedicate just $5 per day to your effort, you’ll have $1,825 at the end of the year; that’s $9,125 in just five years.\nMoney market funds and high-interest savings accounts are two good places to park your emergency fund. You need safe, liquid options so that your money is accessible in times of need. These choices make it harder for you to dip into it (face it: you’ll be tempted to from time to time), and you’ll also earn a bit of return on the money.\nView your emergency fund like an insurance policy. Once you have it, guard it carefully. It’s not a piggy bank. You should not using it for incidental expenses. In fact, as your salary rises, be sure to up the amount to match your new situation.\nUse the fund only in the event of an emergency and spend it carefully when you do need to draw on it. Remember, once that money is spent, it always takes much longer than anticipated to replace it. Start now and save whatever you can, even if it isn’t much. Having an emergency fund gives you a better shot at weathering a crisis without running up a credit card balance or taking out a personal loan.\nFinding the right financial advisor that fits your needs doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with fiduciary financial advisors in your area in 5 minutes. Each advisor has been vetted by SmartAsset and is legally bound to act in your best interests. If you’re ready to be matched with local advisors that will help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.",

      "Steps to take to be financially secure—now, and into retirement Setting short-term financial goals, as well as midterm and long-term, is an important step toward becoming financially secure. If you aren’t working toward anything specific, you’re likely to spend more than you should. You’ll then come up short when you need money for unexpected bills, not to mention when you want to retire. You might get stuck in a vicious cycle of credit card debt and feel like you never have enough cash to get properly insured, leaving you more vulnerable than you need to be to handle some of life’s major risks. Even the most prudent person can't prepare against every crisis, as the world learned in the pandemic and many families learn every month. What thinking ahead does is give you a chance to work through things that could happen and do your best to prepare for them. This should be an ongoing process so you can shape your life and goals to fit the changes that will inevitably come. Annual financial planning gives you an opportunity to formally review your goals, update them, and review your progress since last year. If you’ve never set goals before, take the opportunity to formulate them so you can get—or stay—on firm financial footing. Here are goals, from near-term to distant, that financial experts recommend setting to help you learn to live comfortably within your means, reduce your money troubles, and save for retirement. KEY TAKEAWAYS Proper financial and retirement planning starts with goal setting, including short-, intermediate-, and long-term goals.  Key short-term goals include setting a budget, reducing debt, and starting an emergency fund. Medium-term goals should include key insurance policies, while long-term goals need to be focused on retirement. Short-Term Financial Goals Setting short-term financial goals give you the foundation and the confidence boost that you'll need to achieve the bigger goals that take more time. These first steps are relatively easy to achieve in as little as a year: Create a budget and stick with it. Build an emergency fund. Pay down the credit card debt that's holding you back. Establish a Budget “You can’t know where you are going until you really know where you are right now. That means setting up a budget,” says Lauren Zangardi Haynes, a fiduciary and fee-only financial planner with Spark Financial Advisors in Richmond and Williamsburg, Virginia. “You might be shocked at how much money is slipping through the cracks each month.” An easy way to track your spending is to use a free budgeting program like Mint. It will combine the information from all your accounts into one place so you can label each expense by category. You can also create a budget the old-fashioned way by going through your bank statements and bills from the past few months and categorizing each expense with a spreadsheet or on paper. You might discover that ordering Seamless every work-from-home day (or spending that much on lunches with co-workers if you're back in an office) is costing you $315 a month, at $15 a meal for 21 workdays. You might learn that you’re spending another $100 per weekend on date-night meals with your significant other. When you see how you are spending your money and you're guided by that information, you can make better decisions about where you want your money to go in the future. Is the enjoyment and convenience of eating out worth $315 a month to you? If so, great—as long as you can afford it. If not, you’ve just discovered an easy way to save money every month. You can look for ways to spend less when you dine out, replace some restaurant/takeout meals with homemade ones, or have a combination of the two. Create an Emergency Fund An emergency fund is money you set aside specifically to pay for unexpected expenses. To get started, $500 to $1,000 is a good goal. When you meet that goal, you’ll want to expand it so that your emergency fund can cover greater financial difficulties, such as unemployment. If you didn’t have an emergency fund prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, you likely wished you did. And if you did have one, you may have tapped into it and need to replenish it. Ilene Davis, a certified financial planner (CFP) with Financial Independence Services in Cocoa, Florida, recommends saving at least three months' worth of expenses to cover your financial obligations and basic needs, but preferably six months' worth—especially if you are married and work for the same company your spouse does or if you work in an area with limited job prospects. She says finding at least one thing in your budget to cut back on can help fund your emergency savings. Another way to build emergency savings is through decluttering and organizing, says Kevin Gallegos, vice president of sales and Phoenix operations with Freedom Financial Network, an online financial services company for consumer debt settlement, mortgage shopping, and personal loans. You can make extra money by selling unneeded items on eBay or Craigslist or holding a yard sale. Consider turning a hobby into part-time work from which you can devote the income to savings. Zangardi Haynes recommends opening a savings account and setting up an automatic transfer for the amount you’ve determined you can save each month (using your budget) until you hit your emergency fund goal. “If you get a bonus, tax refund, or even an ‘extra’ monthly paycheck—which happens two months out of the year if you are paid biweekly—save that money as soon as it comes into your checking account. If you wait until the end of the month to transfer that money, the odds are high that it will get spent instead of saved,” she says. Though you probably have other savings goals too, such as saving for retirement, creating an emergency fund should be a top priority. It’s the savings account that creates the financial stability you need to achieve your other goals. Pay Off Credit Cards Experts disagree on whether to pay off credit card debt or create an emergency fund first. Some say that you should create an emergency fund even if you still have credit card debt because, without an emergency fund, any unexpected expense will send you further into credit card debt. Others say you should pay off credit card debt first because the interest is so costly that it makes achieving any other financial goal much more difficult. Pick the philosophy that makes the most sense to you, or do a little of both at the same time. As a strategy for paying off credit card debt, Davis recommends listing all your debts by interest rate from lowest to highest, then paying only the minimum on all but your highest-rate debt. Use any additional funds you have to make extra payments on your highest-rate card. The method Davis describes is called the debt avalanche. Another method to consider is called the debt snowball. With the snowball method, you pay off your debts in order of smallest to largest, regardless of the interest rate. The idea is that the sense of accomplishment you get from paying off the smallest debt will give you the momentum to tackle the next-smallest debt, and so on until you’re debt-free. Gallegos says debt negotiation or settlement is an option for those with $10,000 or more in unsecured debt (such as credit card debt) who can’t afford the required minimum payments. Companies that offer these services are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and work on the consumer’s behalf to cut debt by as much as 50% in exchange for a fee, typically a percentage of the total debt or a percentage of the amount of debt reduction, which the consumer should only pay after a successful negotiation. Consumers can get out of debt in two to four years this way, Gallegos says. The drawbacks are that debt settlement can hurt your credit score, and creditors can take legal action against consumers for unpaid accounts. Bankruptcy should be a last resort because it destroys your credit rating for up to 10 years. Midterm Financial Goals When you’ve created a budget, established an emergency fund, and paid off your credit card debt—or at least made a good dent in those three short-term goals—it’s time to start working toward midterm financial goals. These goals will create a bridge between your short- and long-term financial goals. Get Life Insurance and Disability Income Insurance Do you have a spouse or children who depend on your income? If so, you need life insurance to provide for them in case you pass away prematurely. Term life insurance is the least complicated and least expensive type of life insurance and will meet most people’s insurance needs. An insurance broker can help you find the best price on a policy. Most term life insurance requires medical underwriting, and unless you are seriously ill, you can probably find at least one company that will offer you a policy. Gallegos also says that you should have disability insurance in place to protect your income while you are working. “Most employers provide this coverage,” he says. “If they don’t, individuals can obtain it themselves until retirement age.” Disability insurance will replace a portion of your income if you become seriously ill or injured to the point that you can’t work. It can provide a larger benefit than Social Security disability income, allowing you (and your family, if you have one) to live more comfortably than you otherwise will if you lose your ability to earn an income. There will be a waiting period between when you become unable to work and when your insurance benefits will start to pay out, which is another reason why having an emergency fund is so important. Pay Off Student Loans Student loans are a major drag on many people’s monthly budgets. Lowering or getting rid of those payments can free up cash that will make it easier to save for retirement and meet your other goals. One strategy that can help you pay off your student loans is refinancing into a new loan with a lower interest rate. But beware: If you refinance federal student loans with a private lender, you may lose some of the benefits associated with federal student loans, such as income-based repayment, deferment, and forbearance, which can help if you fall on hard times. If you have multiple student loans and won’t stand to benefit from consolidating or refinancing them, the debt avalanche or debt snowball methods mentioned above can help you pay them off faster. Consider Your Dreams Midterm goals can also include goals like buying a first home or, later on, a vacation home. Maybe you already have a home and want to upgrade it with a major renovation—or start saving for a larger place. College for your children or grandchildren—or even saving for when you do have children—are other examples of midterm goals. When you've set one or more of these goals, start figuring out how much you need to save to make a dent in reaching them. Visualizing the type of future you want is the first step toward achieving it. Long-Term Financial Goals The biggest long-term financial goal for most people is saving enough money to retire. The common rule of thumb that you should save 10% to 15% of every paycheck in a tax-advantaged retirement account like a 401(k) or 403(b), if you have access to one, or a traditional IRA or Roth IRA. But to make sure you’re really saving enough, you need to figure out how much you'll actually need to retire. Estimate Your Retirement Needs Oscar Vives Ortiz, a CPA financial planner with PNC Wealth Management in the Tampa Bay/St. Petersburg, Florida, area, says you can do a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation to estimate your retirement readiness: Estimate your desired annual living expenses during retirement. The budget you created when you started on your short-term financial goals will give you an idea of how much you need. You may need to plan for higher healthcare costs in retirement. Subtract the income you will receive. Include Social Security, retirement plans, and pensions. This will leave you with the amount that needs to be funded by your investment portfolio. Estimate how much in retirement assets you need for your desired retirement date. Base this on what you currently have and are saving on an annual basis. An online retirement calculator can do the math for you. If 4% or less of this balance at the time of retirement covers the remaining amount of expenses that your combined Social Security and pensions do not cover, you are on track to retire. 4% is the Highest initial withdrawal rate for retirement that has survived all historical periods in U.S. market history, assuming a diversified portfolio of stocks and intermediate government bonds. If, for example, you started with a portfolio of $1 million and withdrew $40,000 in year one (4% of $1 million), then increased the withdrawal by the rate of inflation each subsequent year ($40,000 plus 2% in year two, or $40,800; $40,800 plus 2% in year three, or $41,616, and so on), you would have made it through any 30-year retirement without running out of money. “This is why you often see 4% as a rule of thumb when discussing retirement,” Vives Ortiz says. “In most scenarios, you actually end up with more money at the end of 30 years using 4%, but in the worst of the worst, you would have run out of money in year 30,” he adds. “The only word of caution here is that just because 4% has survived every scenario in history does not guarantee it will continue to do so going forward.” Increase Retirement Savings For most people who have an employer-sponsored retirement plan, the employer will match a percentage of what you are paid, says CFP Vincent Oldre, president of Assured Retirement Group in Minneapolis. They might match 3% or even 7% of your paycheck. You can get a 100% return on your investment if you contribute enough to get your full employer match, and this is the most important step to take to fund your retirement. “What kills me is that people do not put money into their retirement plan because either they ‘can’t afford to’ or they are ‘afraid of the stock market.’ They miss out on what I call a ‘no-brainer’ return,” Oldre says. Michael Cirelli, a financial advisor with SAI Financial in Warrenville, Illinois, recommends making IRA contributions at the beginning of the year as opposed to the end, when most people tend to do it, to give the money more time to grow and give yourself a larger amount for which to retire. The Bottom Line You probably won’t make perfect, linear progress toward achieving any of your goals, but the important thing is to be consistent. If you are hit with an unexpected car repair or medical bill one month and can’t contribute to your emergency fund but have to take money out of it instead, don’t beat yourself up; That’s what the fund is there for. Just get back on track as soon as you can. The same is true if you lose your job or get sick. You’ll have to create a new plan to get through that difficult period, and you may not be able to pay down debt or save for retirement during that time, but you can resume your original plan—or perhaps a revised version—when you come out on the other side. That’s the beauty of annual financial planning: You can review and update your goals and monitor your progress in reaching them throughout life’s ups and downs. In the process, you will find that both the small things you do on a daily and monthly basis and the bigger things you do every year and over the decades will help you achieve your financial goals.",

Through a budget, you might monitor how much cash is flowing in and out of your household.\nBeyond basic tracking, one of the purposes of budgeting is to help you plan your money goals and manage your funds to hit those goals.\nWithout a budget in place, it’s all too easy to prioritize what’s right in front of you over your future financial security.\nFor example, a budget can include a line item for sinking funds. If you set aside a certain amount of funds every month, you’ll have those savings to fall back on in an emergency. But it’s often very challenging to save for unforeseen emergencies without a set budget to guide you.\n11 reasons you need a budget\nA recent survey from Mint discovered that around 65% of Americans weren’t sure how much they spent in the last month.\nAt the same time, a survey from Debt.com found that 85% of respondents have used a budget to keep themselves out of debt or pay off debt.\nFor those that don’t stick to a budget, the reasons included taking too much time, feeling anxious about budgeting, not having enough income, and a source of conflict between partners.\nWhether you currently stick to a budget or not, many reasons might encourage you to stay on top of a budget. And if you struggle with answering, "what is the purpose of budgets?" below you’ll find a look at eleven key reasons why you need a budget.\n1. Track spending\nFirst and foremost, a budget helps you keep track of your spending. When you keep tabs on your spending, it’s easier to stay on track toward your financial goals.\nImpulse spending is less likely to happen if you know it will be recorded in your budget.\nHow to keep track\nPerhaps the most important purpose of budgeting is to stay on top of your expenses. Within your budget, you’ll need to keep a log of the purchases you make. While you can keep track with pen and paper, there are automated spending trackers out there.\nPersonally, I like to use a spreadsheet to keep track of my spending. At the end of every month, I can see exactly how much I spent and where all of the money went.\n2. Track income\nOn the flip side of tracking your expenses, one of the purposes of budgeting is to help you track your income. After all, you cannot keep spending unless you have money coming through the door.\nWhen first building your budget, you’ll typically work backward from how much you make.\nFor example, if you have $3,000 in income per month, you would divide that over your spending obligations and savings goals.\nTracking income can reveal that you need to earn more\nBut in some cases, tracking your income will illuminate that your income is too low to make ends meet. Although this discovery can be disheartening, uncovering an uncomfortable gap between your expenses and your income is critical.\nOnce you understand the gap, you can start building your income by pursuing raises or creating other income streams.\n3. Plan out savings goals\nWhether you’ve labeled them or not, everyone has savings goals. For example, saving for a luxurious vacation, retirement, or a new vehicle all count as savings goals. You likely have your own unique savings goals.\nIt’s often easier to make progress toward these goals by including them in your monthly budget. When you map out a budget, consider including a set amount of money for your goals.\nFor example, you might choose to dedicate $100 per month toward a down payment on a house. Whatever your savings goals are, the purpose of budgets is to present a pathway to achieving them.\n4. Take control of your finances\nWithout a budget, it’s easy to let life happen to your finances. Life without a budget can be more difficult than it needs to be.\nFor example, many feel the pressure to overspend around the holidays. Although the holidays come around at the same time every year, it’s easy for these expenses to sneak up on your budget.\nWith a budget in place, you can include a holiday sinking fund for the festivities.\nSo if you\'re wondering "what is the purpose of budgets?", it is to help you plan for future expenses. Instead of just getting through today, a budget can help you think about tomorrow.\n5. Financial freedom\nWhen you think of a budget, you might start to feel constrained. But the reality is that with the right mindset, one of the purposes of budgets is to provide financial freedom.\nA carefully thought-out budget gives you the freedom to spend within those limits.\nExamples of financial freedom\nFor example, you might set a discretionary purchase category in your budget. The next time you head to the store, you won’t have to feel guilty about making a purchase that fits within those boundaries.\nBeyond freedom from spending guilt, a budget can help you move toward financial freedom. If you set aside money each month, you might break the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle or even retire early at some point.\n6. Track your progress toward financial goals\nFinancial goals come in many shapes and sizes. Depending on where you are in your financial journey, your goals will look different.\nA few popular financial goals include paying off credit cards, eliminating car loans, building an emergency fund, and saving for retirement. But everyone can set up a financial goal for their unique situation.\nA key feature of budgeting is the ability to monitor your progress toward long-term financial goals. With the help of your budget, you can stick with your savings strategy to make your financial goals a reality.\n7. Highlight wasteful spending\nOne of the purposes of budgets is to help you highlight wasteful spending.\nFor most of us, wasteful spending creeps into our lives over time. Whether we spring for extra clutter that turns into junk around the house or overspend on things that don’t matter to us, most of us will spot some level of wasteful spending.\nUnderstand what categories you typically overspend on\nWhile a budget might not totally eliminate wasteful spending, it can help you uncover what categories you are likely to overspend within.\nPersonally, I tend to overspend on food during busy periods of my life. When I notice that my food spending is growing too fast, it’s a good reminder to slow things down and get back into my meal-planning routine. \nWhen you spot overspending, don’t feel guilty. Instead, try to move forward with less wasteful spending next time around.\n8. Lower financial stress\nFinancial stress can put pressure on everyone in the household. But without a budget, it’s easy for financial stress to get out of control.\nEssentially, the purpose of budgets is to help us understand how much we can afford to spend in any given category. Without these guardrails in place, it’s all too easy to overspend on something that just doesn’t fit in the budget.\nUnfortunately, overspending outside of our budgets can lead to taking on debt. Luckily, a proactive approach to managing your finances with a budget can help you avoid stress.\n9. Increases financial communication for couples\nManaging money as a couple has its challenges. The purpose of a budget for your household is that it can serve as a neutral tool for both parties to understand the situation better.\nWith the help of a shared budget, both partners can see how their spending affects the household. Instead of one partner pointing out the issue, a budget can lay out the problem in black and white. Typically, a budget is a good place to start money conversations as a couple.\n10. Assess spending triggers\nEmotional spending is an issue that many Americans struggle with. According to one study, 49% of Americans report emotions as a cause for spending more money than they can afford to.\nWhen you are tracking your purchases through a budget, you can look over the expenses with a clear head. Sometimes, you’ll be able to spot your spending triggers.\nFor example, you might notice that you head to the store after a bad day at work. As you start to recognize the signs, you can make small changes that could really impact your financial situation.\n11. Match your spending with your values\nWhen you build a budget, you have the opportunity to spend your money based on your values.\nWithin your budget, you can choose to spend money on the hobbies and experiences that matter to you. Plus, you can cut out things that you don’t want to support.\nA value-based budget can be a game-changer for your budgeting mindset. Instead of feeling trapped by a budget, choosing to align your spending with your values can help you feel in control of your budget.\nThe purpose of budgets is to stay in control of your finances!\nWhen you set a budget and stick to it, you are taking control of your financial situation. You can use your money system to work toward your long-term financial goals.\nDon’t be afraid to give this a try. The purposes of budgeting are too important to be overlooked and can help you spend intentionally and save more money!\n',

      "Why Are We So Emotional about Money?\nIf money brings up a lot of emotions for you, you’re not alone. Financial expert Ramit Sethi explains our relationship with money is just as personal and valuable as any other relationship in our life. Here are some ways to build a healthier relationship with money.\nFirst, know that it’s okay to feel emotional about money. Use them to understand your values, your fears, your needs, and your wants.\nThen, start educating yourself about money. Understand what terms like credit, loan, compound interest, etc. mean. Often, the fear of money comes from a lack of knowledge or awareness about it.\nFinally, be inspired by money. Instead of focusing on what you don’t have, think about what money can buy. Don’t just focus on the materialistic aspects but also the experiences it affords you.\nHow do you feel about money?\nI’ll go first. Money allows me to pay bills and function in a capitalistic world, but besides that, I don’t associate positive emotions with it.\nMoney, I imagine, is something that belongs in my future. I feel greedy every time I spend it on myself and often fall into the trap of comparing my financial situation to that of my friends. I spiral into a dark hole of negative self-talk — the expensive events I can’t afford playing on a loop in my head — because I know I will spend my entire 20s chipping away at my massive student loan debt.\nMoney is messy. It’s complicated. It’s oh-so-very-emotional. I know I’m not the only person who feels this way. So, how do we cope?\nAccording to Ramit Sethi, author of I Will Teach You To Be Rich, the psychology behind our relationship with money is very underrated. In his new podcast, Sethi dives into the confusing emotions many of us feel when it comes to our finances. His advice is clear: Our feelings are almost always unrelated to the financial decisions we make and indicative of something much deeper.\nI spoke with Ramit about what makes money so emotional and how to build healthier relationships with it. Here’s what he had to say.\nWhy is money such an emotional topic? \nAnything important in our lives is emotional. Our relationships are emotional, our work is emotional, and so is our money. One of the misconceptions about money is that it’s all math. We believe that there is a mathematically correct answer for questions like, “Should I buy a house or rent one?” or “Should I go to graduate school?” or “Should I take this job?” or “Should I negotiate a higher salary?”\nSure, doing the math can help you answer these questions, but there’s no foolproof formula to making money decisions.\nBuying a house can mean you don’t have to pay rent. Renting, on the other hand, can help you live in a city you’ve always wanted to live in. Going to university might be your route to a better career or to a promotion. Our relationship with money is just as personal and valuable as any other relationship in our life. So, it’s an emotional topic — as it should be.\nI find that the feelings money elicits in me are mostly negative, and this is true for many of my peers. For example, I have a student loan that I’ve been repaying for the last five years. Even though the loan paid for my college education, I feel a lot of shame and guilt when I think about my debt. Rationally, I know getting the degree was a good decision, but it doesn’t feel good anymore. I feel anxious when I look at what I’m earning versus how much I’m saving and investing. How do I get out of this cycle of negative emotion? \nFirst of all, it’s very normal to feel different emotions at different stages of your life. Imagine that you are going out to climb a mountain. You spend months training for it, you buy your gear and equipment, and you get to the bottom of the mountain. You feel good. That’s how a lot of us feel when we’re starting college and applying for a loan. You may not fully understand how that’s going to impact the rest of your life but you’re ready to go.\nThen, you start climbing the mountain and you reach the first peak. You may look around and say, “Wow, I climbed a long way,” but you also realize there’s a lot further to go than you realized. You might start thinking about everything you need to do to keep going. The end of college can feel the same way. Now, you have a college education, but you also have debt.\nThis is where it gets tricky because a lot of us fixate on all the feelings around how much there’s left to do. In terms of a loan, that looks like thinking about what you’ve mortgaged, the interest on your loan, how much money you have to set aside every month to make a payment, and the kind of job you’d have to do to get where you want to go next.\nOften, this feeling can be aggravated by looking around and comparing yourself to others or even your own life before you took on debt. You can’t go on vacation, but your friends are able to. You feel like you’re missing out. Someone just bought a car, but you’re not able to afford a car right now. Maybe your parents are helping you out to repay your loans, and that makes you feel guilty. Slowly, you may begin to ask yourself if it was worth it.\nDo any of these resonate with you?\nAll of them! You’re right about the journey. Even after five years, it looks like I have a long way to go. Is that normal?\nIt is. But your feelings are not correlated with your debt. You may think that paying off your debt will make you happy, but once you do, there’s going to be another thing to worry about. This doesn’t mean that your feelings aren’t valid. It just means that your emotions don’t always give you the full picture of your financial situation.\nLet’s try this instead: What do you imagine your life would be like if you didn’t have any debt?\nHonestly, debt feels like an obstacle. If I could remove that obstacle, I imagine that I’d be able to make choices more freely.  \nOkay, let’s look at that more closely. When you speak about debt, it sounds like you want to go back to zero and start fresh.\nThis is classic example of a scarcity mindset, where you are focused on what you don’t have, or you believe there will never be enough of something. This could be money, time, or anything really. This scarcity mindset can make you operate from a place of fear. You’re playing not to lose instead of playing to win. You feel like you have to give up on vacations. You might be afraid of negotiating your salary because you’re scared of losing your job — and having a job feels more secure than asking for what you want.\nOften, it’s this feeling that people in your situation need to work on. I know it may be difficult to believe, but this feeling of scarcity or fear doesn’t go away after repaying a debt.\nEven if you were to win $1 million tomorrow, you would find yourself stressing about something else in life, for instance, what to do with that $1 million or if it’s even really “enough” money to live the life you want. Your mindset won’t change unless you specifically work to improve it.\nHere’s what I want you to know: You don’t have to wait another five or 10 years to do what you really want to do today.\nHow does one shift their mindset? It doesn’t sound easy at all. \nYes, it will take time. The simplest way to reframe this kind of thinking is to flip how you think about your financial decisions. Instead of thinking about everything your loan couldn’t do for you, ask yourself what you gained from it.\nPerhaps you gained an opportunity to study abroad or live on your own. Perhaps you met people who you still have relationships with, who taught you things, and or who you had valuable experiences with. Empirically, we know that those with a college degree have access to better jobs and incomes. That’s a win for you. Pay attention to it.\nAnother long-term approach to changing your mindset is investigating your ideas, thoughts, and feelings about money.\nThe first step is to think about what I call your ”rich life.” When you’re thinking about your finances, ask yourself why do you want to be rich? What does money mean to you and what are you working towards?\nYou’re not just applying an arbitrary monetary value to buying a fancy car or luxury handbag (although those are perfectly fine) but looking deeper to understand what you want your life to look like.\nWe all have a rich life, and everyone’s definition is different. Money is one part of your rich life but what else does it include? Get as specific about your rich life as possible. If you want to travel, what would the destination be? Do you know the exact date and year you would want to travel to this place? If you want a better job, what does that better job look like? Can you visualize the role, the company culture, your pay package, and what kind of projects you’d want to work on?\nYou can also go even more granular and ask yourself what you’d want today to look like.\nThis exercise is all about understanding who you are and what you want your life to look like as precisely as possible. Don’t be afraid to change this vision. It’s likely that some of your values and priorities will shift over time. Let your rich life help you become aware of what you want your life to look like every day — and use it to stay grounded.",

      'Previous research has shown that money can’t buy happiness, but what is it about the pursuit of money that makes people so unhappy? "Our research suggests that people who base their self-worth on money believe that the more time they spend working, the more likely they will be to achieve financial success," study co-author Dr. Lora Park, associate professor of psychology at the University of Buffalo, tells Inverse. "However, the downside is that when people\'s self-worth is tied to money, they spend less time with their family and friends, which is related to feeling more lonely and disconnected from others." Park and her co-authors based their findings on research that involved more than 2,500 participants over five different studies that looked at factors such as time spent with others, loneliness, and social disconnection. Participants were asked to document their feelings in a daily diary for two weeks to assess their feelings about the importance of money and time spent engaged in various social activities. The findings were published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin. The Buffalo researchers based their paper on the psychological concept known as Financial Contingency of Self-Worth, when people view their financial success as being tied to the core of who they are as a person. These individuals feel good when they think they’re doing well financially but have feelings of worthlessness when they feel financially insecure. Study co-author Deborah Ward, a Buffalo graduate student and adjunct faculty member in the psychology department, pointed out that it’s not the desire to achieve financial success or the pursuit of money that’s an issue. It’s only when a person’s self-worth is tied to these things. So how could people maintain a healthy relationship while pursuing financial goals? "Goals related to mastery, autonomy, and relatedness will ... lead to greater happiness and psychological well-being." "Reflect on why you want to achieve financial success," Park said. "Oftentimes, we think that what we are pursuing will make us happier, but in fact, research shows that after a certain amount of income, money doesn\'t buy happiness. So rather than pursuing money as the ultimate goal, think about ways to satisfy fundamental psychological needs of competence (feelings of mastery), autonomy (feeling like you have choice and ownership over your life), and relatedness (close, mutually caring relationships with others) — and spend time directly fostering those needs." For individuals in a crunch or hustle period, Park advised that they carve out certain times daily or weekly to focus on strengthening their relationships with others. Not only will loved ones appreciate this time, but it will also benefit everyone’s mental and physical health. Many times, however, the pressure to succeed or earn more money doesn’t come from within but from others, such as partners or parents. This is classified as external motivation, Park said, meaning people may feel pressured to avoid a negative outcome, including disapproval from others or to achieve a positive outcome such as seeking approval. Park said that motivations can shift. "Instead of being motivated by external reasons, or even a desire to feel good about oneself (and not feel badly about oneself), individuals can value a goal because it\'s an important part of their value system or beliefs," she said. "For example, we might say that financial security is an important goal because we want to be able to provide for ourselves and our family. When you\'ve adopted a goal that you feel is your own, rather than being dictated by those around you, then you feel ‘freer’ to pursue the goal and feel less controlled and pressured to achieve it." Park said that it can be difficult to change people\'s contingencies of self-worth or what they base their self-worth on, so if a loved one has tied their financial success to their self-worth, it’s important to help them find other goals to pursue. "Goals related to mastery, autonomy, and relatedness will better fulfill psychological needs and lead to greater happiness and psychological well-being," she said, "than trying to boost your self-esteem by pursuing financial success." Abstract: Although people may think that money improves one’s relationships, research suggests otherwise. Focusing on money is associated with spending less time maintaining relationships and less desire to rely on others for help. But why does focusing on money relate to worse social outcomes? We propose that when people base their self-esteem on financial success—that is, have financially contingent self-worth—they are likely to feel pressured to pursue success in this domain, which may come at the expense of spending time with close others. Consistent with this idea, results of four cross-sectional studies (N = 2,439) and a daily diary study (N = 246) revealed that basing one’s self-worth on financial success is associated with greater feelings of loneliness and social disconnection, and this may be related to experiencing less autonomy and spending less time with family and friends.',

      "A financial therapist explains how to shift your personal money narratives. Never have Americans been in so much debt. According to data from the Federal Reserve, consumer debt — including mortgages, credit card debt, student loans, and car loans — among the lowest-earning 90 percent of American households rose to $13.8 trillion in September 2022, up from $2.5 trillion in 1989. Over a third of Americans carry credit card debt from month to month, per a survey from personal finance site Bankrate, and those credit card balances hit a record high in 2022 with borrowers averaging $5,474 in credit card debt, according to TransUnion. About 45 million — or nearly one in five — Americans have student loan debt. Inflation, price increases — for utilities like natural gas and for groceries like eggs — and wages that fail to keep pace with the rate of inflation contribute to personal financial strains no amount of budgeting can allay. The lowest earners are hit the hardest, with the greatest share of their paychecks allocated to bills like rent, utilities, and groceries. Even with the pause on student loan repayments, many have turned to credit cards to make ends meet. Given its pervasiveness, having debt shouldn’t be a personal reflection on those who have it, yet carrying any amount of debt can be embarrassing and shameful, says licensed marriage and family therapist Nicolle Osequeda, who is also a member of the Financial Therapy Association. However, recognizing how emotions interplay with finances is the key to changing the narrative around your relationship with money. Osequeda offers insight on the insidious ways debt impacts every aspect of life. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. What are some common threads that come up in people’s personal narratives around money? There are a lot of “shoulds”: I should do this or I shouldn’t do this about debt. Incurring debt is something that people feel really embarrassed and shameful about. It’s a cycle of “I shouldn’t have had to do it,” but then people become stressed out if they have to put something on the credit card again. There’s another layer of “I’ll never get out of this, this is something that I’m destined to struggle with for the rest of my life.” That can become people’s money narrative or their belief about how they are able or are not able to manage money. There is this belief in our culture that we should be able to do all of the things — and I’m not even talking about frivolous things, either. We want to be able to keep the lights on and provide for our family. But then there is that discrepancy between what the necessities are and actually having the funds to do it. Sometimes they just don’t meet. Especially with inflation and salaries remaining the same, costs are going up, and they still need to get the things that they needed before but there isn’t exactly the same financial security as they had previously. Has accruing debt always been a shameful thing? There are different kinds of debt [that aren’t seen as shameful]. For example, student loan debt: It’s [seen as] a good thing. But maybe not taking out a short-term loan because you want to make sure your family has food on the table or you can pay the electric bill. Or if you want to buy a fancy purse or a car, maybe that’s not seen as okay. It seems like in order to be able to better yourself, there’s a belief that debt is okay. But if it’s [in the service of] a thing that people don’t value as much, people are more critical about it. How can we break the unhelpful money narratives we’ve written for ourselves? First, identify what is my narrative or how I see myself with money. I don’t feel like everybody has the choice to be able to change their narrative as easily as other people do. But if you are able to make a shift in how you see your ability to manage money or pay off debt, you can then slowly identify small goals, even if it’s not a huge chunk that you’re able to pay off. For example, when I was in college, I racked up quite a bit of credit card debt. That stuck with me into my adulthood, the belief that I just wasn’t good with money. I had to take a step back and say, “No, it’s not that I’m not good with money. It’s that I made a few errors that stayed with me for a while.” My narrative about money shouldn’t be based on what I did when I was 20 years old. But it sticks with us. There aren’t many people that don’t carry some sort of debt. So it’s not necessarily that because you have debt, you are bad with money. That’s not true. A lot of people incur debt for things that are completely out of their control: an accident, a job loss. But because we have so many negative connotations associated with debt, it’s hard to talk about it. When we don’t share things, we keep them inside and they grow and that’s where most of those narratives begin. There’s nobody there to challenge them. We need to put some light on it and have someone that can support us to make a plan. What advice would you give people dealing with the shame of debt? Let’s talk about it. What does it bring up for you? How did you get here? Then, where do you want to go? What are some small things that you can do today and tomorrow that can start to shift your money narrative? Why is it worth interrogating ourselves in this way? Because money isn’t going away. We need it. We use it. It’s always going to be present in our lives. So how do we want that relationship to be? What might offering support to a loved one in debt look like? I would first say, “I’m so happy that you shared that with me. That must be really hard to be going through. Why don’t you look at the full picture? What are you actually dealing with here? How can you address the debt based on the highest interest rates?” There are so many resources online to help people understand how to start to pay down debt. There’s nonprofits that do financial coaching to help consumers that have racked up debt. There’s places that will create payment plans for you. There’s also terrible ones out there, so you have to be careful, but the nonprofit ones are the ones that you want to look for that can give you counseling. Do you find that people maybe work harder toward other relationships, like their relationships with fitness or sleep, and not so much with money? Yeah, because it’s hard for us to talk about money. It’s just not a topic that we talk about a lot because it’s personal. We don’t talk about our struggle with money as much as we even talk about our struggles with our fitness journey. You never hear people say, “I’ve really been trying not to spend on my credit card and I just had a terrible weekend where I spent so much.” No, you hear about someone saying, “I’ve been trying to go to cycling class and I didn’t go at all this weekend.” No one’s gonna blink an eye. There’s so many other areas in our lives where it’s okay to say, “I don’t know how to do that. Let me learn how.” With money, I think it’s getting there. There is less shame around debt. But there isn’t a lot of room to say, “I’m not good at budgeting,” or, “I spent too much and now I have a lot of interest and I’m not quite sure what to do next.” It’s important that we create that space for people to be accepted with debt, not knowing the next step, because we do that in a lot of other areas of our lives. It’s not as easy as saying, “Okay, just pay off your credit card bills.” Because that’s very surface level. Unless you dig a little bit deeper, you’re going to probably do the same thing again.

      'It\'s no surprise that Americans are ready to start spending as the Covid pandemic eases. After being cooped up for a year, people are opening their wallets for anything from dining out to shopping for merchandise and vacations. But will your buying spree bring you joy? It depends, said researcher Elizabeth Dunn, PhD, chief science officer for financial technology firm Happy Money and author of "Happy Money: The Science of Happier Spending." As her book suggests, Dunn conducts research on spending and happiness. Everyone\'s needs are different, so she first advises you identify what purchases are making you happy, and which ones are not. It\'s also a good time to look back on what you discovered you could live without during the pandemic. "So much of our spending is habitual," said Dunn, who is also a professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of British Columbia. "I run to the coffee shop and buy a latte because that\'s what I did yesterday," she added. "We can stop and think, is this actually making me happy?" She also cautions about retail therapy — the idea that spending money on something material will help you feel better. It could give you an immediate boost, but it may not be long-lasting, Dunn explained. "Buying a lot of material things just doesn\'t seem to deliver much in the way of lasting happiness compared to some of these other purchases that we might make," she said. Over a third of Americans engage in retail therapy, a new survey from U.S. News & World Report found. Of those who do, about 34% said they do it frequently and almost 51% said they don\'t have a budget. If you have the money in your budget and you are looking to find joy when making purchases, here are five ways to do it. Buy experiences Research shows that people tend to get more happiness out of buying experiences rather than material things, Dunn said. "Experiences tend to be more tightly connected to our sense of self," she explained. "People feel that their experiential purchases contribute more to their life stories, are more unique to them." They are also less likely to exhibit buyer\'s remorse because experiences are relatively difficult to compare, whereas material things are easy to compare. Plus, experiences tend to bring people together. "Coming out of the pandemic, but also all the time, because we\'re human, when we are able to build and reinforce our connections with other people, that\'s a really important source of happiness," said Dunn. Make it a treat We get used to the things we have all the time, but when they\'re a treat, they tend to bring more happiness. In one of Dunn\'s studies, participants were given chocolate. Those who gave it up for a week enjoyed it more than those who were able to have it every day, she said. Identify things you originally enjoyed but now take for granted. "Just taking a break from them can be a way to both cut down on spending, while also potentially increasing our happiness," Dunn said. Since the pandemic forced a break from many of our habitual purchases, it\'s a good opportunity to bring each one back one at a time, Dunn suggests. Buy time One underutilized strategy for increasing happiness is spending money to get more time in your daily life. "People who use their money to buy their way out of the things they hate doing are happier than those who don\'t," Dunn said. That can mean hiring a cleaning person or family helper to run errands. Pay now, consume later If you pay in advance for an experience you are doing in the future, you get to capitalize on a pleasurable period of anticipation, Dunn said. "When we invest in our future selves, when we sort of pay upfront for things we\'re going to enjoy later, that does seem to be at least \'correlationally\' linked to better financial outcomes, as well." Invest in others When Dunn was conducting experiments on how happy people were when you gave them money, she realized the givers also felt good. "What we\'ve discovered is that people were actually getting more happiness out of money that they used to benefit others, than money that they used to benefit themselves," she said.',

      "How To Set Savings and Financial Goals A Successful Financial Plan Starts With Clear Goals Saving money matters when it comes to leading a richer financial life. Having money in the bank can make it easier to weather emergencies or to realize your dream of owning a home. Setting clear money goals is the first step in making savings a regular part of your financial routine. Why You Need Financial Goals Setting financial goals allows you to put hopes and dreams into action. It starts with choosing a goal, then developing a plan for achieving it. For example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau advises using the SMART goal-setting system. It requires your financial goals be:1 Specific Measurable Attainable Relevant Timebound Outlining money goals this way can give you the direction and the motivation you need to follow through on them. Here’s what a SMART goal might look like for an emergency fund:   QUESTION  ANSWER Specific  What are you saving for?  An emergency fund Measurable  How much do you want to save? $3,000 Attainable  Is this a reachable goal? It is if I earn more, spend less, and plan. Relevant  Why is this important to you? I need to be prepared for surprise expenses. Timebound When do you want to reach the goal? In 12 months Action To Take: Set Two Savings Goals for This Year When setting financial goals, less can be more. Set too many goals and you may feel completely overwhelmed. That could lead you to give up before you begin. If you're not sure what to focus on with your money goals, there's a simple way to approach it. Choose one financial goal you can achieve in the short term, and one money goal to focus on for the long term. Short-Term Financial Goal: Build Emergency Savings An emergency fund can be a lifesaver when you have an unexpected expense. According to Federal Reserve data, 30% of Americans wouldn't be able to cover a $400 expense using cash or its equivalent.2 If you don't have a rainy-day fund or you've depleted yours, saving for emergencies should take priority over other savings goals in the short term. First, determine how much you need and want to save. For example, you may want to save three- to six-months' worth of expenses. Or you may choose to save a set dollar amount. You could then break that goal down to determine how much you need to save each month to achieve it. So if you want to save $3,000 for emergencies in the next year, you'd need to aim for $250 in savings each month. Note A savings goal calculator, like this one, can do the math for you. Long-Term Financial Goal: Think Big When setting your second money goal, consider what you want to accomplish in the next five, 10, or even 20 years. For example, you might want to buy a home. So saving cash for a down payment and closing costs could be your big money goal. Or you may want to stash away money for retirement instead. When setting longer-term financial goals, start with a set dollar amount. Next, work backward to figure out what you need to save monthly or yearly. For example, if you want to save $20,000 toward a home over the next four years, you'd need to save $5,000 each year. That breaks down to $416 and change each month (not counting interest or investment gains). Note As you set your short- and long-term financial goals, consider where to keep your money. A high-yield savings account, for example, could help you earn more interest on your emergency fund compared to a regular savings account. Opening a CD or creating a CD ladder might be preferable when saving for longer-term goals. Next Steps and More Resources Setting money goals is an important link in the chain when working toward financial wellness. Once you've set some broad goals, you can work on fine-tuning them. For example, you next can turn your focus to building short-term savings for the fun things in life, as well as the occasional curve ball.

      "Emergency fund This article contains details specific to United States (US) investors. Parts of it do not apply to non-US investors. An emergency fund is a cash reserve required to meet unanticipated needs for cash, such as medical bills, car or home repair, or job loss. The quantity of emergency funds is usually specified as an integer multiple of monthly expenses, e.g., three months to one year's worth of expenses.[1] The goal of the emergency fund is to provide a cushion of liquidity[2] in the event of unexpected expenses or of a loss of regular income due to unemployment. Emergency funds should be placed in a highly liquid, low risk vehicle (for example, money market, bank savings account). It is generally best to establish a modest emergency fund while getting any employer match to an employer retirement plan (e.g. 401(k) or 403b) and paying down high-interest-rate debt (such as credit card debt) before investing for longer range goals such as retirement, college expenses or a home down payment. Placement of the emergency funds Emergency funds should be placed in a highly liquid, easy to access, low risk vehicle with guarantee on the capital. Checking account Money market fund (High Yield) (insured) savings account. Reward checking account [RCA] : somewhat higher return, if one is willing to put in the effort to set-up. It might be useful to keep some real cash around for those emergencies where one does not have access to bank accounts. Multi-tiered emergency fund By far the most common emergency that would require dipping into the emergency fund is the loss of a job. Since in such a scenario you will not need all the funds at once, some investors seek to have multiple tiers of emergency fund so that funds not needed for several months can be placed in short-term bonds (including CDs) to earn higher yield. Those investment products include very short-term treasury bills, as well as CDs (which often have embedded options which allow them to be cashed in at any time for a small penalty). I bonds (which after some period can be cashed in at no cost) can also form a part of this second tier of emergency fund. For instance, a multi-tiered emergency fund could consist of: Three months of expenses in cash (bank account or money market fund) The next three months of expenses in CDs with the option to cash them in for three months of interest The next three months of expenses in a short-term Treasury bond fund. Selling these would risk incurring some loss of principal due to interest rate changes, but since the odds of needing to rely on your emergency fund for more than six months are slim, some would consider this an acceptable compromise. A note on unemployment benefits The most common emergency is job loss. In the United States, many workers who are laid off are eligible for unemployment insurance payments. The details regarding eligibility and the size of the benefit vary by state. An important part of your planning should be to find out the rules in your state, and try to determine if you would be eligible, and what the size of the benefit would be. In a very rough sort of way, the unemployment benefit could be about 50% of salary, up to a maximum of about $500 per week, for a maximum of six months; this implies that for many people unemployment insurance could serve as part as an \"emergency fund,\" with a value of over $10,000. Cash emergency fund vs line of credit Some people view various forms of credit (particularly HELOCs[3]) as suitable for emergency funds; others strongly disagree. Credit lines can often be withdrawn with little or no notice, and some emergencies which require drawing on the emergency fund may also cause a creditor to question your ability to repay. Roth IRA as an emergency fund See also: Roth IRA as an emergency fund In some situations, a Roth IRA can be used as emergency fund. Contributions (that is, the money that you put into your Roth) can come out at any time, free of taxes and penalties. This is not true of earnings on your contributions, which are subject to more complex rules.[4] It is also possible to withdraw penalty-free (but not tax-free) from a traditional IRA for certain excepted emergencies and major life events.[5] A Roth IRA is primarily intended for retirement, not to store emergency funds. One should consider the impact to portfolio allocations and potential custodial costs. There are behavioral considerations, as well. If a choice is to be made between funding a Roth IRA and an emergency fund, a Roth IRA can be used as an emergency fund in the appropriate situation.[6] Also consider that funds in investment accounts (Roth IRA) are not immediately available. Check with the fund provider, as several days may be needed for the fund transfer process to complete. Health savings account as an emergency fund A Health Savings Account (HSA) can be used to pay for unexpected medical expenses tax-free, as long as they are qualified.[7] Normally, non-medical (and unqualified medical) distributions from an HSA would be taxed as income and assessed an additional 20% penalty. However, if medical expenses are qualified, incurred since the establishment of the HSA, paid out of pocket, and appropriately documented, they can be reimbursed in a future year. So a running tally of reimbursable expenses can be kept, allowing tax-free withdrawals along the same lines as Roth IRA contributions. Note that this strategy puts the shorter-term need for liquid, low-risk emergency funds in opposition to the longer-term tax savings of appreciated assets in the HSA. If only part of the HSA is considered part of the emergency fund, the two parts (emergency fund and long-term growth) of the HSA should have different asset allocations and be carefully tracked. As with using Roth IRA contributions for emergencies, any withdrawals would permanently reduce tax-advantaged 'space'. For that reason, and because HSA funds might not be available as quickly as bank accounts, HSA funds should probably only be considered a 'later tier' of the total Emergency Fund. Additional considerations If you are applying for financial aid for college or grad school, HSAs are excluded as income in the FAFSA® (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) form.",

Yes, you can still have a positive impact on your financial future if you're starting late in life — but if you're 59 years old and just beginning to think about financial freedom, you have a lot of work to do. But if you're 19, you have an extra forty years to set yourself up for financial success. This extra time makes a ginormous difference! A lot of this is due to the magic of compounding. Over the short term, your investment returns don't help a whole bunch. But over the long term? Over decades? Wow! Compounding can help you create a truly impressive wealth snowball. I once received email from a reader named Anders who testified the power of compounding: I used to save money in funds without knowing more than it gave a better interest than ordinary savings accounts. Then a few years ago I came across a book that explained compound interest and showed graphs of how it works. I was blown away by the idea! I think, for me, that was the biggest impact on my way of thinking about savings and it got me more interested in the stock market too. So in my opinion, the things people who don't know too much about savings/investing need to hear is about how compound interest works and how the stock market works. We'll leave \"how the stock market works\" for another day. (If you want to know more right now, check out my articles on stock market returns and how to invest.) Today I want to look at why some folks consider compounding to be the most powerful force in the universe. The Power of Compounding On its surface, compounding is innocuous — even boring. How much does it matter if you start saving now? Will it really affect what you can spend in the future? To illustrate the power of compounding, I spent far too much time playing with spreadsheets. (Seriously. Kim managed to get like three major projects done in the time it took me to generate the following numbers and graphs. But I had more fun.) Note: All of the numbers that follow are based on certain assumptions. For each of the three asset classes — stocks, bonds, gold — I'm using the long-term average real return: 6.8% for stocks, 2.4% for bonds, and 1.2% for gold. That's what these investments return over decades (not year to year) after accounting for inflation. However, it's very important to undertand that average is not normal. Returns can (and do) vary widely from year to year. First up, here's a basic look at compounding in action. This table assumes you invested one dollar into each of stocks, bonds, and gold. Based on historical averages, I've calculated how much your dollar would have grown to at the end of each year for fifty years: As you can see, compounding doesn't really do much during the first few years. After a decade, your $1.00 would nearly double if invested in stocks. (Remember, this is inflation-adjusted. The nominal number would be greater. But this is what your dollar would be worth.) If invested in bonds, that $1.00 would grow to $1.27. And if you invested in gold? That $1.00 would grow to $1.13. (For the record, my research shows that real estate offers long-term returns similar to gold. Others say real estate returns are worse than gold.) The longer your money remains invested, however, the more powerful compounding becomes. After ten years, your $1.00 in stocks grew to nearly $2.00. Afters sixteen years, it will grow to nearly $3.00. In 20 years, it'll grow to nearly $4.00. In 24 years, it'll be worth more than $5.00. From there, the growth becomes even more rapid. By year 40 — which, yes, is a very long time — you're earning more than a dollar every year. Compounding a One-Time Investment That's a fine hypothetical example, but nobody invests just a dollar. Let's assume instead that you made a one-time $5500 investment in your Roth IRA. How would your future returns on that investment vary depending on where you put the money? Here's a table that demonstrates: As you can see, compounding can make a huge difference — especially when time is allowed to magnify the difference in annual returns. (This is one reason index funds outshine managed mutual funds. Index funds, as a whole, earn that 6.8% average annual return that the overall stock market earns. Managed funds earn that less fees, which average about 2%. That's not much in the short-term, but it's a huge amount in the long-term.) For the visual thinkers out there, I've created a series of charts that dramatically demonstrate the difference that compounding can make over time. Over fifty years, compounding can make a dramatic difference if you're able to earn higher returns on your investments! (Who has a fifty-year investment horizon? Well, your typical college student does, for one.) The Importance of Saving Now, it's often said — sometimes even by me — that your investment returns are less important than your investment contributions. That is, how much you invest matters more than where you invest it. Here, for instance, is an XKCD comic belittling the power of compounding: How true is that? Let's look at another hypothetical example. In this case, assume you invest $5500 on January 1st for the next fifty years. How would your investments grow in this case? Here's the table: And here are the charts: Look at that! Investing more does make a difference. Shocking! Sarcasm aside, there are a couple of things to note about these numbers: First, investing more absolutely produces better results. The more you contribute, the more there is to compound. If you want to build a wealth snowball — and I hope you do — the best thing you can do is invest as much money as possible. Second, when you invest more, you erase some (but nowhere near all) of the difference between the rates of return. Take a look at our one-time investment example. In that situation, stocks double gold by year 13 and they double bonds by year 16. But with ongoing investments, it takes stocks 21 years to double gold and 26 years to double bonds. Yes, the amount of you save is more important than the returns you earn. That said, there's no denying the extraordinary power of compounding over time. Real-world numbers bear this out. A Real-Life Example Finally, let's look at a real-life example or two. These are actual numbers from actual accounts. To start, here's the balance history for the 401(k) I started back when Get Rich Slowly was throwing off huge wads of cash: The blue line represents my actual balance over time; the orange line represents my balance if I had not been invested. (In other words, if I were earning no return because I stuffed my money under a figurative or literal mattress.) I've contributed a total of $60,518 to this 401(k) since the end of 2008. In that time, it's grown $117.121.19 so that my balance today is $225,331.75. That's 193.5% growth in just over eight years (or 12.31% annually). Here's a second example, this time with the moved money from my box factory retirement plan to a rollover IRA: Here, I've contributed a total of $65,027.41 to the account — most of it in 2009, but a few thousand just last month. (I closed a smaller IRA and moved the proceeds to this account.) In that time, I've gained $86,425.88. That's 132.9% growth (9.73% annually) in under eight years — all because of compounding. The Bottom Line Based on all of this, there are three keys to make compounding work for you: Start early. The sooner you start, the more time compounding has to work in your favor, and the wealthier you can become. The next best thing to starting early is starting now. Yes, if you start investing at age 19, you'll enjoy better results by the time you're 65. But even if you're 59, compounding is your friend and you shouldn't hesitate to invest. Stay disciplined. Make regular contributions to your savings and retirement accounts, and do what you can to increase your deposits as time goes on. Your goal should be to generate as large a saving rate as possible, to widen the gap between what you earn and what you spend. Don't be tempted to cash out a retirement account when you switch jobs. I see so many people make this mistake, and it makes me want to cry. Don't be tempted to sacrifice your future security for a few bucks today. Be patient. Don't touch your investments. Compounding only works if you let your money grow. Remember: You're creating a wealth snowball. At first, your returns may seem small, but they'll become enormous as more money accumulates. Do these things, and your wealth snowball will grow. Sure, there might be some years where your investment balance decreases rather than increases. Again, that's normal. The examples I've used here assume stocks, bonds, and gold return a stead annual average. They don't. Their returns fluctuate — sometimes wildly. But, over long periods of time, your investment accounts should steadily swell. For a brilliant example of compounding in real life, turn to American statesman Benjamin Franklin. When he died in 1790, Franklin left the equivalent of $4400 to each of two cities, Boston and Philadelphia. But his gift came with strings attached. The money had to be loaned out to young married couples at five percent interest. What's more, the cities couldn't access the funds until 1890 — and they couldn't have full access until 1990. Two hundred years later, Franklin's $8800 bequest had grown to more than $6.5 million between the two cities! True story.",

      "How to Get Into the Habit of Saving More Money Making a Focused Effort Is Key if Saving Doesn't Come Naturally Most people want to save more money, but without a solid plan and good habits, it’s easy to fall short of your financial goals. Life interferes, and money slips through the cracks. Before you know it, the end of the month has arrived, and you’re no closer to saving than when you started. By focusing on small wins, making automatic deposits, and resisting the temptation to “borrow” from yourself, you can get on the path to financial stability. Here’s how to go about establishing habits of saving more money so that it becomes second nature. Celebrate the Small Savings When you’re just starting out with saving, it’s easy to discount your efforts. Even if you’re only able to set aside $5, focus on the fact that you’re saving something. Give yourself permission to start slowly; if you save $5 every week, you’ll have $260 at the end of the year. As long as you’re moving in the right direction, you’re focused on what really matters: establishing the habit of saving. Once you gain momentum, you can take a look at your budget and figure out saving opportunities that you might not have immediately recognized. Tip If you’re not sure where to start or how much you should be putting into your savings account, here’s a method to try: Start by saving 1% of your monthly income, and increase that by 1% each month. Set Up Automatic Transfers Setting up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings account can get you started saving money without thinking about it—assuming you have a budget in place and know your expenses and savings goals. If your checking and savings accounts are at the same bank, that will be easier to do. You simply open the number of savings accounts you need for your different goals, and then set up automatic monthly (or weekly) transfers from your checking to your savings. Using the same bank for checking and savings may also allow you to divide your direct-deposited paycheck. You can direct most of your paycheck to your checking account and deposit a percentage or a set dollar amount into your savings. You’re much less likely to miss that amount if it comes straight out of your paycheck. Sometimes having separate banks for each account is a good thing, because you're less likely to transfer money out of your savings due to the hassle. Savings Account Tips and Tricks For some people, the best way to save is to have short- and long-term goals. Ideally, you’ll have three to six months' worth of living expenses set aside for emergencies. Resist the temptation to dip into your emergency fund, and treat your savings accounts as off-limits. You can budget part of your income into short-term savings for specific goals, like a vacation, and into long-term savings for big-picture items, like a down payment on a new home. Be disciplined about not making withdrawals unless it’s a life-or-death situation. Some banks apply penalty fees if you go over a certain number of withdrawals from a savings account in a given period, which is an excellent disincentive to withdraw funds. Warning While some savings accounts come with debit cards for easy withdrawals, you should avoid using them. You want to make it harder to withdraw from your savings, not easier. Question All of Your Purchases Make sure your purchases are in line with what you want in life. If you know that a vacation is more important to you than packages of your favorite snacks, it might be time to cut back on the junk food in favor of saving money on your grocery bill—money that can be put toward your vacation fund. Whatever your vices are, the point is to stop buying things thoughtlessly. Ask yourself whether your spending is bringing you any happiness or bringing you closer to your goals. If it’s not a necessity, like food, water, and shelter, and it’s not making you any happier or helping you, cut it. Tips for Deciding on Purchases  One of the most straightforward ways to decide on a purchase is to determine how many hours of work it will take you to afford it. For example, if you earn $25 per hour, and you want to buy a $200 purse, you should think about whether that purse is worth eight hours of your life. It also helps to set a grace period on purchases before making them. If something costs more than $50, give yourself a day to think about it. After 24 hours, you might find you don’t really want it as much as you thought. A quick gut-check can help you avoid buyer’s remorse, too. Ask yourself whether you want the $200 purse more than your biggest savings goal; if not, walk away. Important The goal is simple: Become a mindful consumer instead of a mindless one, and you’ll likely discover that saving is easier than you thought. Budget for Your Savings One common reason so many people make it to the end of the month and wonder where all their money went is that they don’t account for any extra expenditures. Don’t make this mistake. Instead, take a look at your expense,s and see whether you’re spending more or less than your projected amount. You should be keeping track of how much you think you’ll spend during the month and how much you actually spend. The difference should go into savings. If your budget says you should have money left over, and the problem is that you’re spending it before it can be saved, this method will help. Estimate your savings, and work that into your automatic transfers. You can also work backward. Start with your salary, and subtract all of your expenses from it. If there is anything left, direct the remainder of it somewhere to avoid spending it. Try the Anti-Budget Not all strategies work for everyone, of course; not everyone is a natural saver, and not everyone loves budgets or spreadsheets. If you know that you'll get bored or tired of meticulously tracking your expenditures, there’s another method you might want to try, sometimes known as the \"anti-budget.\" You simply pull your savings from the top and spend the rest. There are no budget categories to keep track of. All you need to know is how much you can afford to save each month. You shouldn’t try to save so much that your checking account balance is $0 before you can pay the bills, but once you find a suitable amount—one good rule of thumb is to save 20% of your income—set up an automatic transfer at the beginning of the month so that your savings are put aside first. Keep Your Goals Realistic Saving money often means making sacrifices, and it can wear you down after a while. If your self-imposed restrictions on spending are too strict, you may be setting yourself up for failure. It’s like going on a really strict diet; if you deny yourself for too long, you may snap and undo all of your good work. Set up an occasional reward for yourself. For instance, if you have a long-term goal of saving $10,000, and that means giving up that daily latte and your monthly happy hour with friends, set mini-goals along the way. Once you hit $2,000, reward yourself with a latte, or visit happy hour for the first round of drinks. There’s no reason that saving money has to be a completely miserable experience, and by giving yourself small rewards, you’ll reinforce the idea that you’re doing something that will, quite literally, pay off in the end.",

      "What is an emergency and rainy day fund? Here’s how to set one up Give yourself some peace of mind by saving for life’s unexpected surprises. Especially in uncertain times such as this, saving for an emergency fund and a ‘rainy day fund’ is a great way to give yourself some peace of mind for the future. And with so many of us living from paycheck to paycheck—and often having less than a month’s salary saved up in reserves—creating a financial buffer is essential for keeping your budgeting goals on track, and to stop you from getting into debt. But how much should you put into an emergency fund, and what is the difference between this form of saving and a rainy day fund? Let’s find out! What is an emergency fund? To put it simply, an emergency fund is a financial safety net that protects you from life’s unexpected events. Instead of having to rely on your bank account’s overdraft, or having to borrow money to help you out in a crisis, you can dip into this designated crisis fund without worrying about the knock-on effect for the rest of your finances. But, what counts as an emergency? An emergency fund should only be used when something truly unexpected happens, which needs your urgent attention, and that you have no choice but to pay for. Examples of when to use it could include: If you unexpectedly lose your job and lose your source of income If you need to pay for sudden medical expenses If the economy goes into a recession and you lose a significant amount of income If you suddenly have to relocate to look after an ill relative How does a rainy day fund differ? A rainy day fund is similar to an emergency fund, but its function is to pay for life’s smaller surprise expenses. These one-off expenses include covering situations like the following: Having to purchase a new fridge if your current one breaks down Vets bills if your cat needs medical attention Car repair bills Buying a new phone if your current one gets stolen While all of these expenses are necessary, they aren’t quite as costly or dramatic as the reasons for dipping into your emergency fund. When should I budget for an emergency or rainy day fund? By saving into an emergency and a rainy day fund, you are essentially buying yourself peace of mind for the future. When crisis hits—large or small—your finances won’t add to your stress levels as these will already have been taken care of, so you can get on with what needs to be done. To get ahead and enjoy that extra peace of mind that comes with knowing that you’ve got money stashed away, it’s best to move money over whenever you can—or at least once a month to maintain some sort of cash flow. The benefits of an emergency and a rainy day fund The advantages of having both an emergency and a rainy day fund are priceless. Here’s why: You’ll reduce stress, safe in the knowledge that you have a financial safety net. You’ll develop a money-saving mentality, and preparing for the future is more likely to prevent you from making rash financial decisions in the present. An emergency fund also protects you from dipping into other savings accounts when a crisis hits, helping you to stay on target with all of your budgeting and saving goals. How much should I save each month? Experts estimate that an emergency fund should include around three to six months worth of your fixed monthly living expenses (including rent, insurance fees, gas and electricity bills). While some opt to also include their variable expenses (grocery shopping, money for nights-out and general entertainment) into the emergency fund budget, it’s more common to focus on ensuring that you have up to six months of your monthly fixed costs stored away in savings. The amount that you need depends on your lifestyle Whether you decide to save three or six months of your fixed costs is dependent on your means and current lifestyle. Those who live in one-person households, and those with more unstable revenue streams—such as freelancers—might be safer opting to save for six months. This is because their financial safety net may be a bit thinner than those in a two-person household, where someone else can be a financial support in a crisis, and than those with a more regular source of income. Rainy day fund––how much should you save? A rainy day fund should hold enough money to cover you for some of life’s smaller emergencies, but it really depends on your own individual circumstances. While estimates vary between €500 and €2500, if you can, it’s best to err on the side of caution and set aside at least €1000. However, it’s worth considering that while €1000 should be enough to cover things such as replacing a household appliance or paying for a surprise vet bill, it might not be able to cover both of them simultaneously. Try to predict how much you will need for your rainy day fund A great way of working out how much you should set aside for your rainy day fund is to try to assess your current situation, then see if you can predict any future expenses. This will give you a clearer idea of whether you should aim to save €500 or more. Such foreseeable circumstances may include: The cost of car repair if you have a car that is prone to breaking down Vet bills if you have an older pet Dental bills if you have a history of requiring frequent dental work Assessing the age and functionality of your essential appliances, especially those that are no longer covered by any warranty. Once you have a clearer idea of what may constitute your potential smaller surprise expenses down the line, you can reach a better estimate of how much money to budget into your rainy day fund, and then better prepare. Start saving for a rainy day fund before saving for an emergency fund Because your rainy day fund is easier to save for, it’s worth focusing on getting that set aside first before moving on to your emergency fund. You’re more likely to dip into your rainy day fund more often than your crisis fund, since the chances of your fridge breaking down or your plumbing going awry is greater than that of you experiencing a life-changing emergency. Consequently, it’s a good idea to have a buffer for life’s smaller surprises on hand, and it helps keep your emergency savings targets on track. Here’s how to create an emergency and a rainy day fund Starting and maintaining an emergency and a rainy day fund may seem daunting at first, but if you follow these steps, it’s actually pretty easy. By including these funds in your monthly budget, saving for them simply becomes a habit. Here’s how to set them up, step-by-step: Make a budget The first step to saving for an emergency fund and a rainy day fund is to create a solid budget. By following these stages, you’ll be well on your way to start saving for an emergency: Track all of your expenses for 30 days, noting down all of your incomings and outgoings. Make a distinction between your fixed and your variable costs. Your fixed costs are all the costs you have little choice over (rent, debt repayments, car insurance) whereas your variable costs are more flexible (grocery shopping, money spent on nights out, gym membership). Decide what percentage of your variable costs you could use to contribute monthly towards first, a rainy day fund, and secondly, to an emergency fund. For example, if your income is €3000 a month and your fixed costs are €2000 a month, you’d be left with €1000 a month of variable costs. From here, you might decide to save 25 percent, which would be €250 a month. By the end of the year, you’d have saved €2500, which could constitute your entire rainy day fund plus the beginnings of your emergency fund. Use an emergency fund calculator If you’re really struggling to work out how much to set aside in your emergency savings every month, it might be worth considering using an emergency fund calculator. You can easily find these calculators online. These will help you work out exactly how much you’d have left to add into your emergency fund after extracting all of your fixed costs. It is, however, worth finding an emergency fund calculator that allows you to input many variables, since this will give you a more realistic view of how much you can put into your emergency savings each month. Save something, at least It’s important not to get disheartened if saving for six months of fixed living costs seems like too great a number. Saving something is always better than nothing.For example, if you manage to save €30 a week, that’s still €1440 a year, which is still a significant amount. Due to their very nature, an emergency might happen tomorrow, or not for ten years. If you continued to save €30 a week for ten years, then you’d still have a substantial €14,400 protecting you from any financial crisis! Make your savings automatic Once you’ve set up your budget, it’s a good idea to make saving for your emergency fund automatic. This means setting up a direct debit from your account into your savings account every month so that you don’t even have to think about doing it manually, and you’re less tempted to start spending it. Adjust your budget monthly Being flexible with your budget given inevitable shifts in your incomings and outgoings is essential if you want to avoid becoming demotivated.. Every month it’s worth checking if you can really afford to put your budgeted amount into your emergency or rainy day fund. Alternatively, you might be able to put in a bit more than you had anticipated! Create a fallback budget An emergency or rainy day fund should only be used in times of necessity, as should a fallback budget. A fallback budget is basically the budget you adhere to when a crisis hits and money becomes more sparse. It covers all of your fixed costs and perhaps enough to cover basic grocery shopping, but nothing else. This means that you spend the very least amount that you can in a month in the hope that your emergency savings fund—plus any extra freed up cash generated by using your fallback budget—can cover the costs of your immediate emergency. Celebrate your successes Perhaps the most enjoyable part of saving for an emergency or rainy day fund is rewarding yourself each time you achieve a significant milestone. For example, say you are aiming to create an emergency fund of €6000. Every time you save €1000, perhaps you treat yourself to a special dinner or a trip to the cinema, or you book yourself in for a new haircut. It’s important to make the process enjoyable, as this means you’re more likely to stick to your savings goals. Where to keep your emergency fund and rainy day fund Your emergency and rainy day funds should be kept somewhere that you can access easily in a crisis. A digital bank with a debit card, or a designated savings account are ideal, as you can withdraw money easily, wherever you are. It’s also important that you keep your emergency and rainy day funds separate from each other and from your daily savings account, as you don’t want to be easily tempted to dip into them. Quick ways to add to your rainy day fund jar and boost your emergency fund Like most things that are worth doing, beginning is nearly always the hardest part. However, saving money may be easier than you think. If you’re struggling to get the ball rolling with your rainy day and emergency saving goals, here are some excellent ways to free up some extra cash to give yourself a head start: Put any tax rebates, work bonuses, or money you’ve received as a gift straight into your savings funds. Free up some extra money and declutter your home simultaneously by selling any unused items online. Consider taking up a side gig or putting in a few extra hours at work, then using this extra cash to boost your emergency or rainy day funds. Attempt a no-spend month, or if that’s too difficult, nominate one day per week where you spend nothing (with the exemption of your necessary fixed costs, of course!).",

      "6 Ideas For Saving Money In A Jar If saving were easy, then everyone would do it unprompted. But that’s not the case. Sometimes we have to make things fun and interesting to motivate ourselves, like saving money in a jar. According to a Bankrate survey, only 4 in 10 Americans can cover a $1,000 emergency expense from savings. Of course, there are other factors that affect our ability to save like wages not keeping up with inflation. But ultimately, we focus on what we can control to protect our financial health, and we can certainly find ways to make it fun. So, let’s dive into some fun ideas for saving money in a jar. Why use jars for saving money? Why should you use this money savings jar method to save money? Here are some of the benefits. You can watch your savings pile up When comparing the effects of using cash versus credit and debit cards, a study found that people may spend up to 100% more when shopping with a credit card. This is because holding the money and actively giving it up to buy something makes people pause. And most of the time, the pause holds us back from making an impulse buy. Conversely, seeing cash accumulate in a money savings jar motivates people to keep saving. It makes saving a habit It’s also a fun way to save. The excitement of a new method can get people to save. And the sense of accomplishment they get from seeing their money build up leads to the practice becoming a habit. It helps people who don't save money naturally Using jars for saving money is also a great starting point for people who aren’t natural savers (like me). The most difficult part of saving is actually doing it, so a small start is a start no matter what. What can you use the savings for? Saving money in a jar can help fund a lot of things. Here are some suggestions. An emergency fund A savings jar is an excellent way for you to build an emergency fund if you don’t have one. An emergency fund is cash that you set aside so you have something to fall back on when “life happens.” For instance, if your car breaks down or the furnace dies in the middle of winter, then you would have money to cover the costs. Small household expenses If you want to break the habit of reaching for your credit card, you can also use the cash to pay for small household expenses such as gas, cellphone bills, or bus passes. Or you can use it for family fun expenses like dining out, coffee runs, or movie outings. Keep cash on hand Your money savings jar could also just be so you have cash on hand. Technology fails, and you may lose your bank card or forget your pin. For moments like these, it’s good to have cold, hard cash. Fun ways to use jars for saving money You can save money by transferring funds from your checking account to your savings. But saving money in a jar is satisfying because you can touch and see your money accumulate. Plus you can make it fun, too. Here are a few creative ways to use jars for saving money. 1. 52-week challenge For the 52-week challenge, you save $1 for the first week, gradually increasing a dollar each week. At the end of the challenge, you would have saved $1,378. You can also start at higher weekly amounts if you want to save more. Although if you’re new to saving or on a tight budget, starting with $1 is perfectly okay. Make it easier on yourself to keep going rather than getting discouraged midway and not saving. So, get your jar ready. Pick a day to be savings day like payday so it’s easy to remember. Your favorite day or any other day works too. 2. Drop all your coins into your money savings jar This is a good method if you use cash for most transactions or if you work in an environment where you get paid bills and coins. All you need to do is turn in all your change every night or at the end of the week. No cheating! 3. Save for something specific For this approach, think of something you’re saving up for. Are you wanting to get a new couch or go on vacation? Decide how much you’d want to spend. Next, figure out a timeline for your savings goal. Then, calculate how much you need to put in your money savings jar weekly or monthly. Your timeline might depend on when you want or need to buy the item you’re saving for as well. Make sure your timeline is practical and achievable. Give yourself realistic goals that fit into your budget. So, if you’re saving for higher ticket items, give yourself more time. Saving and paying for something in cash is better than giving up and buying it on credit. 4. Follow a savings challenge Make saving money in a jar interesting with a savings challenge. There are many easy challenges you can follow. What you do is simply save a set amount of money according to the rules of the particular challenge. It’s a way to remind you and keep you focused to accomplish your goal. An example is the $5 challenge. The rule is: for the next 90 days, every time you get a $5 bill, you drop it in the jar. It’s fun and it gets you saving. Another one you can try is the find extra money challenge. You might need to get creative to make extra money, but that’s the idea. An easy way to get started is to gather all the spare change in your wallet, car, and around the house. You could also look around your home and sell items you don’t use anymore. Maybe you can pick up extra shifts or work overtime to make more money as well. And all the proceeds go into the savings jar. 5. Save the same amount every week For a simple approach to saving money in a jar, you could also set an amount that you can easily take out of your budget without feeling restricted. Start with $5, $10, or maybe even $50 if you can swing it. Do it for the next three to six months. If you saved $10 every week for 6 months, you’d have saved $240. So, now you were able to put money aside without feeling the pinch. With your cash, you could pad your emergency fund or start a sinking fund for fun things like a spa day. 6. Draw milestones on your money savings jar This approach calls for you to set milestones when saving money in a jar. Make your jar as colorful as you like, be creative. If you’re like me and you can’t draw, you can just paint lines. You can also use amounts as milestones. For instance, your first milestone could be $200. Then, with every line, write down a corresponding reward for yourself when your savings get to that point. Pick small and inexpensive rewards that you can get excited about. These could be getting in the tub for a good soak, ice cream from your favorite place, or pizza for dinner. The idea is to reward yourself at every milestone to keep you motivated and help you achieve your savings goal. Types of jars for saving money Now that you’re excited about using jars for saving money, the next step is to go look for a jar. Use what you have Since the goal is to save, we recommend reusing what you already have. What you’re looking for is a large enough jar to keep your money safe. And use a container that you won’t need for anything else. So, go grab that pickle jar from the recycle bin. Give it a good wash, and you’re all set. Buy a savings jar If you don’t have anything suitable at home, here are jars you can use to get started immediately. Get these from Amazon: Large coin bank jar: This is a plastic coin jar. It’s nothing fancy, but it gets the job done. Glass piggy bank: This is a good size, nice-looking jar. The lid comes off easily, which makes it easy to take money out. It is glass though, so keep that in mind if you have young kids. Piggy bank with coin counter: This jar has the coin counter feature to help you track your savings. The lid is also easy to take off so you can reuse it as many times as you like. Achieve your money goals by saving money in a jar! There is no specific way you have to save, but you can definitely make it exciting and interesting. If you struggle with saving, try saving money in a jar to keep you motivated. Or simply change up your saving approach with the different methods we’ve listed here. You can build your savings and master your spending!",

      'Starting (and Keeping) an Emergency Fund How many times have you heard the financial advice, "Start an emergency fund"? Probably dozens of times. But much as most people would like to have an emergency fund, it can be hard to prioritize saving for a rainy day when the sun is out and you want to plan a beach getaway…or just pay your current bills. But what would happen if your car conked out en route to the beach and you needed a $800 repair? Or if you were unfortunately laid off and couldn’t pay the pile of bills without reaching for your credit card? Those are examples of why emergency savings are so vital. It can be especially hard to save, though, when you don’t know how to build up that financial safety net. This article will change that. It shares step-by-step advice about how to ensure that you can handle the unexpected expenses that can be part of life. Read on to learn: •   How many people have an emergency fund •   How much money you should have in an emergency fund •   How to save for an emergency fund •   Where to keep an emergency fund •   When to use an emergency fund What Percentage of Americans Have an Emergency Fund? Only about 44% of Americans could pay for an unexpected $1,000 emergency expense, according to a recent survey. This means that for 56%, or the majority of citizens, their emergency fund is effectively their credit cards. And remember, a sudden bill of $1,000 isn’t the only reason an emergency fund is crucial — it can also keep you stay afloat if you suddenly lose your job or need to take unpaid time off work. When you consider how to define an emergency fund, you may think it’s just cash to pay those urgent, unexpected bills. And, yes, that’s vital. But if you turn it over a bit, you’ll realize that in addition to covering the out-of-ordinary expenses, it can also keep you out of debt and your phone number out of the hands of creditors. What’s more, an emergency fund should help prevent you from reaching for your plastic when a big bill hits. The idea is not to rack up that kind of high-interest debt, which can be so challenging to pay off. These situations underscore the importance of having an emergency fund. Rule of Thumb When Saving for an Emergency Fund Most financial experts say you should have at least three to six months’ worth of basic living expenses in your emergency fund. That means you should add up the necessities that keep your household afloat (such as shelter, food, medical costs, utilities, WiFi, and so forth) and see what you would need if, say, you lost your job, became disabled, or had to take a leave of absence from work to care for a sick family member. When deciding how much you’d like to have in your emergency fund, you might use another technique vs. adding up all your monthly expenses. Some people prefer to start with their take-home pay, subtract any money they’re already saving, and subtract money they don’t need to spend. With this method, what’s left are your monthly expenses. Another benefit of this method is that it gives you the opportunity to see what spending you can live without, which you can cut out of your budget now and start weaving into your safety net. Some people recommend yet another way to calculate how much should be in your emergency fund. They say to look at the deductibles for auto and health insurance you would have to pay in the event of an accident, emergency room visit, or ambulance ride. That cost is the very minimum amount of money you would have to shell out for a minor misfortune. If money is super tight, that could be a good goal for your emergency fund. Steps for Starting and Building Your Emergency Fund If you are convinced of the value of having this sort of savings and are wondering how to start an emergency fund, follow these steps. They’ll help you know how to save for an emergency fund even if you feel your budget is already quite tight. 1. Setting a Specific Savings Goal As mentioned above, most financial pros will recommend that you save three to six months’ worth of living expenses. You might come up with that sum and then divide it by 12 to see how much you’d have to save monthly if you wanted to accrue the whole amount. Too steep? Try dividing by 24, and see what the two-year horizon looks like. 2. Starting Small and Stockpiling When You’re Able Most young professionals don’t happen to have three to six months’ worth of income just sitting in their checking accounts, waiting to be moved to an emergency fund. If the method above of dividing your goal by 12 or 24 still yields a monthly number that’s too intimidating, start with whatever you can afford. If it’s $25 per month, great: The point is to pick a number and start stashing some cash. You can also look for ways to fund your account from other sources. For instance, you could deposit any minor windfall — a tax refund, bonus, or even a birthday check from Grandma. 3. Making Consistent Transfers If you use the method above of putting a windfall into your account, don’t forget about the emergency fund after that. It’s important to keep adding to it, especially in periods of high inflation. The amount of money you’d need to, say, pay the heating bill or plunk down for a car repair is likely to go up over time. That’s why it’s important to keep funneling some money into your savings. If you have a side hustle going, you might want to make a rule to always deposit 10% or 20% of your earnings into the emergency fund to keep that account growing. Sure, you could spend all that pay and feel rich in the moment, or you can save it and increase your wealth over time. 4. Managing Your Expenses and Spending If you’re feeling as if you just don’t have wiggle room to fund emergency savings, there’s a simple solution: Manage your money better and cut your budget a bit. Take a look, and see where you can make budget cuts. Do you need to eat dinner out three nights a week, or can you cut it down to one? Do you need all of those streaming services you pay for? See where you can eliminate some costs in your budget, and put that extra money towards your emergency fund. 5. Turning on Automatic Saving Automating your savings is a great, relatively painless way to continue saving money for your emergency fund. Set up regular payments from your checking account into your savings account so that money automatically gets transferred on a weekly or monthly basis. You won’t see the cash in your checking and be tempted to spend it. 6. Not Increasing Your Monthly Spending Are you familiar with the phrase "lifestyle creep"? This means that, as you earn more, you start spending more. This means that even as your income grows, you’re not building wealth. If you get a raise and then use it on a more expensive car lease or frequent vacations, your savings will struggle to increase. If you keep your spending in check, you can apply at least some of your salary increases to building up that emergency savings account. Where to Keep Your Emergency Fund Now that you know how to start an emergency fund, consider where to keep it. The whole point of an emergency fund is that it is easily accessible money, so when and if the unexpected happens (like a big dental bill), you will be able to dip into your account. That means it needs to be liquid. You will likely want to avoid accounts that require your money to be kept on deposit for a certain amount of time, like a certificate of deposit (or CD) account. These typically penalize you if you withdraw the funds early. Interest rates are often fairly low for savings accounts, but if you shop around, you’ll find some out there that pay almost 2%. These high-yield savings accounts are typically offered by online banks. Because they don’t have bricks-and-mortar branches and the related expenses, they can pass the savings along to their clients. Another point to note as you build your emergency savings: Look for an account that is FDIC-insured  . Putting this kind of money into the market, which means there’s risk of loss, is probably not a wise idea. You don’t want to have the value of the fund drop. Adding to Your Emergency Fund As noted above, it’s fine to take your time building up your fund, but if you don’t take the first step and start, you’ll never get ahead. If you are struggling (as many people do), to find the cash for this goal, consider these hints: •   Start a side hustle. You could get a weekend gig walking dogs. Or do you love ceramics? Try selling your pieces on Etsy. There is no limit to what you can try, plus a key benefit of a side hustle is making some extra cash, which you can put towards your emergency fund. •   Gamify your savings. One month, go without fancy coffee-bar drinks and put the money saved into your emergency fund. The next month, skip takeout and cook at home. Put the extra cash into your rainy day account. You are likely to see the amount climb. Tips for Staying Motivated to Build Your Emergency Fund One of the biggest challenges some people face in saving for an emergency fund is motivation. If you find yourself tempted to spend your yearly bonus on a new car or status wristwatch, try this instead: For one week, live on the money you’d get if you filed for unemployment  in your state. This is no easy task, and it will give you an idea of exactly what you’re saving up to avoid. If you make it a week, consider if that’s really what you want to go through if you lose your job with no backup in place. Once you commit to focusing on your emergency fund, use the money you didn’t spend that week to start your account. While saving an emergency fund is one of many competing financial priorities, having a cushion to catch you when you fall can prevent a minor calamity from spiraling into lasting debt. The toughest part may be getting started and staying motivated. Just remember, you walk 10 miles by walking 10 feet at a time. When Should I Use an Emergency Fund? When you know you have funds in your emergency savings, it can be tempting to dip into it for a variety of reasons that feel urgent but in truth aren’t. For instance, if a coat you have been coveting is marked down by 60% off, that is not a valid use of your emergency fund. Nor is upgrading to the latest mobile phone because you see a good deal. Here’s when you should use an emergency fund: •   An unplanned, unexpected event •   An expense that is absolutely necessary •   A cost that cannot be covered any other way •   An expense that is urgent and must be paid ASAP Examples of when these situations might occur include a major car repair that must be paid so you can commute to work regularly or your home insurance plan’s deductible after you experienced storm damage. If an expense meets the criteria above, you can breathe easier knowing that you have the money to take care of the bill.',

      "Are you considering investing in cryptocurrency? Though Bitcoin is likely the best-known digital money, thousands of cryptocurrencies already exist.\nCryptocurrency investing can take many forms, ranging from buying cryptocurrency directly to investing in crypto funds and companies. For direct investing in crypto coins, you can buy cryptocurrency using a crypto exchange or through certain broker-dealers. Find out more about how you can invest in one of the newest and most inventive asset classes available.\nCryptocurrency is digital money that is secured by blockchain technology.\nCryptocurrency investing can take many forms, ranging from buying cryptocurrency directly to investing in crypto funds and companies.\nYou can buy cryptocurrency using a crypto exchange or through certain broker-dealers.\nPay attention to transaction fees when making crypto purchases because these fees can vary widely among currencies.\nInvesting in cryptocurrency is risky, so it's important not to invest more money than you can afford to lose.\nWhen you think of investing in cryptocurrency, you might think about buying and holding one or more crypto coins. Buying cryptocurrency directly is probably the most common way to add crypto exposure to your portfolio, but when it comes to investing in cryptocurrency, you have a few different options:\nBuy cryptocurrency directly: You can choose to directly purchase and store one or more cryptocurrencies. Your options range from the most established digital currencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin to virtually unknown coins that are newly released in an initial coin offering (ICO).\nInvest in cryptocurrency companies: You can invest in companies with a partial or total focus on cryptocurrency. Your options include cryptocurrency mining companies, mining hardware makers, companies like Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) and PayPal Holdings Inc. (PYPL) that support cryptocurrency, and many others with varying levels of crypto exposure. You also can invest in companies like MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR), which hold large amounts of cryptocurrency on their balance sheets.\nInvest in cryptocurrency-focused funds: If you don't want to choose among individual cryptocurrency companies, then you can decide to invest in a cryptocurrency-focused fund instead. You have a choice of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as index funds and futures funds, in addition to a range of cryptocurrency investment trusts.\nSome crypto-focused funds invest in cryptocurrency directly, while others invest in crypto-focused companies or derivative securities such as futures contracts.\nInvest in a cryptocurrency Roth IRA: If you want to invest in cryptocurrency and also garner the tax advantages afforded by an individual retirement account (IRA), then you can consider investing in a cryptocurrency Roth IRA. Using the services of a crypto IRA provider can also facilitate more secure storage for your cryptocurrency holdings.\nBecome a crypto miner or validator: Perhaps the most direct way to invest in cryptocurrency is to mine it or act as a validator in a crypto network. Cryptocurrency miners and validators earn rewards in crypto, which they can either hold as investments or exchange for another currency.\nIf you want to invest in cryptocurrency directly, then you can use a cryptocurrency exchange. Here's how to buy cryptocurrency through an exchange:\n1. Choose which cryptocurrency exchange you want to use. Your best bet is a reputable, well-known exchange with a large selection of currencies.\n2. Establish an account with the cryptocurrency exchange. You will need to provide your personal information and verify your identity to complete the registration process.\n3. Fund your account with fiat money. Before you can buy any crypto, you need to fund your exchange account with another currency, such as U.S. dollars.\n4. Decide which cryptocurrency you want to buy. You can choose to invest in one or many cryptocurrencies. Research your options to help you decide.\n5. Place a buy order for your chosen cryptocurrency. Follow the steps required by the exchange to submit and complete a buy order for one or more cryptocurrencies.\n6. Store your cryptocurrency in a digital wallet. After your purchase is complete, the information you need to access your cryptocurrency is held in a digital wallet. That crypto wallet can be hosted either by the cryptocurrency exchange or an independent wallet provider.\nAs an investor in cryptocurrency, you need to decide how much of your portfolio to allocate to digital assets.\nA best practice among investors is to periodically review your entire portfolio to assess the need to rebalance your holdings. That might mean increasing or scaling back your crypto exposure, depending on your investment goals and other financial needs.\nInvesting in cryptocurrency is considered risky. The prices of cryptocurrencies, even the most established ones, are much more volatile than the prices of other assets like stocks. The prices of cryptocurrencies in the future could also be affected by regulatory changes, with the worst-case possibility that cryptocurrency becomes illegal and therefore worthless.\nMany investors are nonetheless attracted to the potential upside of investing in crypto. If you decide to invest, it's important to carefully research any digital coin before buying it. Pay attention to transaction fees when making crypto purchases because these fees can vary widely among currencies.\nThe cryptocurrency space is evolving rapidly, so it's also important to pay attention to new developments that may affect your crypto holdings. Cryptocurrency investors need to understand the tax consequences of using crypto, especially if they purchase something or sell their crypto investments.\nGiven the riskiness of cryptocurrency as an asset class, it's especially important not to invest more money in crypto than you can afford to lose.\nInvesting in cryptocurrency is not for everyone. The prices of cryptocurrencies can be volatile, which makes this type of investing likely a poor choice for conservative investors. If you are willing to assume greater risk as an investor, then investing in one or more cryptocurrencies may be right for you.\nYou can invest in Bitcoin directly by using one of the major cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Coinbase or Binance. Another way to gain investment exposure to Bitcoin is to buy shares in a company with significant Bitcoin exposure, such as a Bitcoin mining company. A third option is to invest in a Bitcoin-focused fund such as an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nYou can invest in Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency without spending much money. Using the Coinbase platform, for example, you can buy cryptocurrency with as little as two units of your local currency.\nFinding the right financial advisor that fits your needs doesn’t have to be hard.

      "Is cryptocurrency a good investment? Cryptocurrency may be a good investment if you are willing to accept it is a high risk gamble which could pay off – but also that there is a strong chance you could lose all of your money. Prices of cryptocurrencies including bitcoin have surged in the past and plunged in 2022, so it is important that if you are planning to invest in them, you go in with your eyes open. Don’t invest unless you’re prepared to lose all the money you invest. Cryptocurrency is an extremely high risk and complex investment, and you are unlikely to be protected if something goes wrong. Times Money Mentor has provided this content for educational reasons only and not to help you decide whether or not to invest in cryptocurrency. Should you decide to invest in cryptocurrency or make any other investment, you should always obtain appropriate financial advice and only invest what you can afford to lose. In this article we explain: Is it a good idea to invest in cyptocurrency? The risks involved in investing in cryptocurrency Is cryptocurrency a good long-term investment? If Ethereum is a good alternative to bitcoin Whether bitcoin is a good inflation hedge Is it a good idea to invest in cryptocurrency? If you invest in cryptocurrency, do it based on the facts, not the hype – and there is a lot of hype. Before you buy and sell digital currency, know the risks so you can judge if investing in it is a good idea for you and your personal finances. Here, we help you understand how cryptocurrency works. The Bank of England would not agree that it is a good investment. Governor Andrew Bailey warned that people who invest should be prepared to lose all of their savings. What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency? Governments and financial regulators in almost every country have warned investors of the risks posed by buying cryptocurrency. And that the warnings have been so emphatic and widespread is partly down to the hype around digital currencies. When an investment makes headlines for soaraway returns, is featured in advertisements or endorsed by celebrities as a way to get rich, investors can pile in without thinking through the possible consequences. 1. Volatility Extreme volatility is a defining factor of cryptocurrency. While you may make high returns, you could also lose everything. 2. Scams In November 2021, around £1 million–worth of cryptocurrency scams were being reported to Santander UK by its customers each month. The scale of crypto fraud overall will be much greater. One of the most common types is when a criminal hacks into your computer and freezes you out of your account. 3. Exaggerated promises of high returns Cryptocurrency firms may also be overstating how much investors could receive from investing in crypto, while minimising the risks. 4. No compensation scheme In the UK, deposits held with a bank or building society which is authorised and regulated by the Prudential Regulatory Authority are protected by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) are protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme; if, say, a bank or building society goes bust, compensation of up to £85,000 will be available to customers through the FSCS. Crypto assets, however, are not regulated by the FCA, and so if the cryptocurrency exchange or platform where you have invested goes bust, there it is unlikely that you will get your money back. For those wanting to get to grips with crypto investing, check out our article: Six cryptocurrency tips (and five mistakes to avoid). “Some firms are offering investments in crypto assets that promise high returns. If consumers decide to invest, they should be prepared to lose all their money.” Financial Conduct Authority, In January 2021 Is cryptocurrency a good way to make money? Early investors in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin will probably have made money. If you had spent £310 to buy one bitcoin in April 2016, six years later your investment would have been worth about £24,000. Past performance is not an indicator of future results. Bitcoin’s price soared through 2021, reaching record highs of $69,000 in November. But the price of bitcoin has been falling in 2022 amid a wider cryptocurrency sell-off as investors steer clear or riskier investments at a time of rising inflation and interest rates. The price of a single bitcoin fell below $20,000 (£17,250) in June 2022 and has loitered around that level since then. As of March 2023, it sits at around $22,400, or £18,620. While that £18,620 value for one bitcoin is far more than its price of £310 in April 2016, the price fluctuations for even the most popular cryptocurrency highlight the extreme volatility of crypto investment. Some new cryptocurrencies are intended to replace traditional currencies such as pounds or dollars. Others are used to create new types of financial application, or swap value between various digital currencies. If you are considering buying into digital assets, look closely at projects individually to see how they might pan out in the future. Investing in cryptocurrency is extremely risky and you should only invest what you can afford to lose. Are you buying a totally worthless digital coin or something that offers innovative solutions to existing financial problems? If you are new to digital assets, read our article on cryptocurrency trading for beginners. What are average returns for cryptocurrencies? There is no guarantee a cryptocurrency will remain in action in the long run. For example, of the top ten cryptocurrencies by market value in 2013, only seven are still functioning today. In 2013, one bitcoin was worth just under $112, and the currency had a total market value – all the bitcoins in circulation multiplied by the price of each one – of just over $1.2bn. On 16 May 2022, one bitcoin was worth about $30,000 and had a total market value of $1.3 trillion. Eight years ago, one litecoin was worth $3.38. In April 2021, it commanded a value of about $245 per coin. Now it is worth about $60. Devcoin, novacoin and CHNCoin are no longer listed by the price-tracking website CoinMarketCap, while freicoin and terracoin have fallen in value and the latter is worth a fraction what it was in 2013. There is a constant stream of new cryptocurrencies entering the market. Dogecoin is just one recent example: it took off in May 2021 but has struggled to sustain investor momentum. Is ethereum a good investment? If the price of any asset rises rapidly, there is always a chance it could fall just as quickly. We have seen that with ethereum in 2022. Launched in 2015, it had been on an upwards trajectory since July 2021, reaching a record high of $4,617. In late January 2022, its price had fallen to $2,411, and as of early March 2023 its value was about $1,560. Bear in mind however that three years ago it was around $240. It is still one of the most popular cryptocurrencies largely because it has more uses beyond just being a cryptocurrency. Still, this doesn’t make it any less volatile. Ethereum is used in smart contracts on the blockchain networks crucial to cryptocurrencies, and payments company Visa recently said it would use it to record crypto payments. But remember there are no guarantees, so don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Check out our guide to bitcoin alternatives here. An important point to bear in mind about investing is that you only lose money if you sell when the asset falls below the price you paid for it, as you end up crystallising your losses. Read more in our beginner’s guide to investing. Can cryptocurrency be a good long-term investment? Yes, according to sophisticated investors such as banks, hedge funds and pension funds. More of them are investing in cryptocurrency than ever before, and investment banking giant JP Morgan Chase advised in February 2021 that investors could consider putting 1% of their investments into bitcoin as a way to diversify their portfolio, according to financial firm Bloomberg. However, this investment advice is aimed at financial professionals and not your average investor who owns a few thousand pounds in stocks and shares. Investing in crypto is fraught with serious risk. Some early investors who have persisted have evidently made themselves rich. Those who haven’t? Well, it should be fairly clear that the value of their investments may have fallen to next to nothing. Top tip: Watch what sophisticated investors are buying. Pension funds or university endowments, which manage billions of pounds in cash and specialise in long-term investments, will often only invest in bitcoin — if they invest in crypto at all. Bitcoin is the original cryptocurrency and commands a high long-term value because it has never been hacked and has maintained 100% uptime since it was launched. Is bitcoin a good inflation hedge? Investment pros have been talking a lot about digital currency as a way for investors to hedge against inflation. When inflation rises, as it is doing at the moment, the value of your cash falls. As the years pass, we can buy fewer goods and services with the money in our bank accounts. Investment options touted as a “hedge” — government bonds or gold, for example — tend to either: Keep more of their value than cash over the long term Or they tend not to be affected by declines in other parts of the economy The first of these potential advantages could also be applied to the stock markets – and, history suggests, to crypto assets such as bitcoin. That’s why so much long-term investment advice is focused on moving cash out of our bank accounts and into stocks and shares that could appreciate over time. Baked into the bitcoin code is the promise that no more than 21 million units of bitcoin will ever be created. So instead of being an inflationary currency like sterling or dollars, some experts argue bitcoin is the opposite: it is deflationary, increasing in value with the passing of time. Of course, the deflationary argument in favour of bitcoin falls down if governments decide to regulate specifically against it. India, for example, has proposed a ban on cryptocurrency trading, suggesting it will impose fines on anyone caught holding onto digital assets of any kind. The regulatory uncertainty that surrounds bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general, is one of the reasons so many investors discount it entirely. On the other hand, where price movements of stocks and shares may well be influenced by the performance of the business, bitcoin has no underlying asset. This means that the movements in its price are based purely on speculation among investors about whether it will rise or fall in future. As a result, there can be violent swings in the price of bitcoin, even in the space of 24 hours. Over the last year, high inflation and a cost of living crisis are causing people to reduce their investment risk by selling their cryptocurrency, which indicates that the value of crypto can be influenced by inflation.",

      "Investors are faced with a variety of choices on where to invest their money (e.g., a taxable account, a 401(k), or an IRA). Knowing which accounts to invest in first will maximize return with a minimum of taxes. Prioritizing investments guides investors on the appropriate order of placing their investments into these accounts.\nInvestors should take care that any investment priority decision is aligned with their Investment Policy Statement.\nHere is a general account funding priority that often works well for many people (not all points will apply to everyone).\n1. Establish an emergency fund to your satisfaction. If you have many other high financial priorities (like paying off high-interest debt), start with a smaller emergency fund, and grow it later over time, as those other priorities are satisfied.\n2. Contribute to an employer retirement plan (e.g. 401(k) or 403b) enough to get the full employer match (the match is like free money, your best possible investment).\n3. Pay off high-interest debt (a guaranteed high return, the next best thing to free money).\n4. Contribute to a Health Savings Account (HSA) if a high deductible health plan is appropriate for your needs (you can think of HSA contributions as also getting a match, from the IRS).\n5. Contribute the maximum to an IRA, traditional or Roth (or backdoor Roth technique), depending on eligibility and personal circumstances. (See below for situations where you may prefer to swap steps 5 and 6.)\n6. Contribute the remainder of the maximum employee contribution to the work-based plan.\n7. If your plan supports it, employ the mega-backdoor Roth strategy.\n8. Pay off medium-interest debt (eg. student loans, car loans, personal loans), especially if the interest is not tax-deductible.\n9. Invest inside a taxable account.\n10. Pay off low-interest debt (eg. most mortgages, some car loans).\nIt is important to realize that these steps are not cast in stone. The above list should be considered with some flexibility for an investor's needs and personal preferences.\nIf the company plan offers good, low-cost funds, it may be preferable to contribute to the company plan before contributing to an IRA; see: Comparison between IRAs and employer plans.\nAlso, an investor's marginal tax rate may influence the decision: those subject to higher marginal tax rates should consider higher contributions to a tax-deferred plan (e.g. traditional 401(k) or IRA) rather than a post-tax plan (e.g. Roth 401(k) or IRA); see Traditional versus Roth for more guidance.\nIf you prefer traditional to Roth, and traditional contributions to the employer's plan are needed to reduce your Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) for traditional IRA purposes enough to allow a full or partial IRA deduction (see IRA Deduction Limits), consider swapping steps 5 and 6.\nTable 1 describes the rationale for investing in the order previously described.\n1. Start building an emergency fund: Have enough cash on hand to cover unplanned expenses. While the exact amount depends on your risk tolerance, a common rule of thumb is to start with one month of expenses, and as you satisfy other financial priorities, grow it over time to around 3-12 months of expenses. (See: Emergency fund.)\n2. Contribute to a work-based retirement plan (eg. 401(k) or 403(b)) enough to get the full employer match: Not getting an employer match is like letting your employer keep part of your salary.\n3. Pay off high-interest debt: Typically these include credit cards and other unsecured loans. Paying off a high-interest debt is a guaranteed high return on your investment, the next best thing to free money.\n4. Contribute to a Health Savings Account (HSA) if a high deductible health plan is right for your needs: HSAs offer tax-free contributions, growth, and withdrawals when used for qualified medical expenses. You can view HSA contributions as being matched by the IRS. If you are in a 25% tax bracket, it costs you $750 to put $1000 in your HSA, and once it is there, it won't be taxed at all as long as you spend it for medical care, so this is as good as $1000 in a Roth IRA.\nAfter age 65, the HSA can also be used for non-medical expenses, with such withdrawals taxed at your regular tax rate. So if you are unlucky and are too healthy after 65, the HSA is still as good as a pre-tax retirement account. Unlike pre-tax retirement accounts, HSA contributions made through an employer are also payroll tax-deductible.\nUse of an HSA requires participation in an IRS qualified high deductible health plan (HDHP) at work. Look at your particular health care needs to decide if you may be better off with a traditional health care plan or an HDHP plus HSA. If the latter, then using the HSA as an investment account can be advantageous.\n5.-7. Contribute to available retirement accounts (eg. IRA, 401(k), 403(b), 457(b)) without a match: Retirement accounts offer either an immediate tax deduction and tax-deferred growth (traditional) or life-long tax-free growth (Roth), plus asset protection and estate planning benefits. These accounts have annual contribution limits which are lost if not used.\nInvestors may have to choose among IRA vs. employer plan and/or traditional vs. Roth accounts and should consult those articles for more details.\nDeductible IRA contributions are subject to income limits, but the income limit for contributing to a Roth IRA may be circumvented by the Backdoor Roth process. Employer plans may also offer mega-backdoor Roth contributions, but these should be made only after normal contributions.\n8. Pay off medium-interest debt: Typically these include student loans, car loans, personal loans, and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs). The choice to pay off debt or invest is based mostly on the expected after-tax rate of return. When the returns are similar, secondary factors sway the decision; see: Paying down loans versus investing.\n9. Invest in a taxable account: As you consider all these steps, keep in mind that your asset allocation (ratio of stocks to bonds), which sets your portfolio's level of acceptable risk, is the single most influential decision you can make on your portfolio's performance. Your chosen asset allocation (% stocks / % bonds) may direct you to skip some of these steps.\n10. Pay off low-interest debt: Typically these include mortgages and other secured debt. Paying off low-interest debt on good terms should be a lower priority than most other funding options, but a higher priority than investing in low-return investments with no tax advantages.\nMany company plans contain high-cost funds which make them unattractive. If you have such a plan, look for one or two index funds or a bond fund that can be used. If your company offers matching funds up to a certain contribution level, it's always wise to use the company plan. If there is no match, the power of tax-deferred compounding and automatic contributions still favors using the plan with limited contributions.\nAlso, if you leave your current employer you will most likely be able to rollover the assets in your poor-quality company plan to either a better company plan, or to an IRA.",

      "Systematic investing occurs when investors make regular, equal payments into a mutual fund, trading account or retirement account, such as a 401k. Systematic investing encourages the establishment of a regular savings habit, and, because purchases are made at various market prices, investors, in essence, dollar-cost-average the average purchase price of the investment.\nWhile most investors experience systematic investment by participating in employer-provided contributory retirement plans, investment firms supply a number of programs which allow investors to set up an individual systematic investment program. These programs include Automatic investment plans and Contractual investment plans.\nMany investment institutions offer an Automatic Investment Plan (AIP), an investment program that allows investors to contribute small amounts of money in regular (monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual) intervals. Funds are automatically deducted from the investor's checking/savings account or paycheck. Mutual funds (both in taxable accounts and IRA accounts), variable annuity subaccounts, and 529 savings plan funds are some of the most common vehicles offering an AIP option.\nInvestors wishing to establish an AIP employing the principles embedded in the Bogleheads' philosophy might consider establishing AIP programs with low cost no-load mutual funds, no-load low cost variable annuities, and direct sold low-cost 529 plan portfolios.\nFINRA, in an investor alert regarding contractual plans, offers the following advice: 'For a specific type of systematic investment plan—sometimes referred to as a 'contractual plan' or 'periodic payment plan'—an investor must make a long-term commitment of 10 or 15 years. While the majority of these plans are sold to military personnel, they are also sold to civilians. These plans come with high upfront costs and are expensive if the full term of payment is not completed. If your goal is to save for retirement, most employer savings and retirement plans allow you to save through payroll deduction. Military personnel can make long-term periodic investments in the U.S. Thrift Savings Plan. This plan has no up-front load and low on-going expenses'\nIn the U.S. Systematic Investment Plans (SIP) are regulated as Periodic Investment Plans under the federal securities laws. A typical SIP contractual plan allows an investor to accumulate shares of a mutual fund indirectly by making small regular monthly payments, usually as little as $50, over a period of 10, 15 or 25 years. Historically, the majority of contractual plans have been sold to military personnel. These plans impose high upfront commission costs, as much as 50% of the first year payments, and are especially expensive if the full term of the plan is not completed.\nContractual plans have the following characteristics:\nHigh first-year cost. You are required to pay a creation and sales charge equal to as much as 50 percent of the first 12 monthly investments. If you increase the amount of your monthly payments, you may owe an additional creation and sales charge on the new investment.\nLong-term investment. Typically, systematic investment plans require 180 fixed monthly payments over a 15-year period, with the option of making payments for up to 25 years (300 investments).\nNo direct mutual fund ownership. Investments in a contractual plan are placed in a trust. The trust invests your regular payments, minus fees and expenses, in shares of a mutual fund.\nMissed Payments. The sponsor may terminate your plan if you fail to make investments for a period of 6 or 12 consecutive months.\nFees and expenses. Plan expenses include creation and sales charge fees, mutual fund management and distribution expenses, and various custodial and service fees. The cost burden of the creation and sales charge is revealed in the following table:\nCancellation and Refund Rights. An investor in contractual plan can cancel the contract with the following rights.\n45-Day Cancellation Right. You will receive a notice of your cancellation rights within 60 days after your first investment in the plan. You can cancel your plan within 45 days of the mailing date of that notice. If you choose to cancel your plan, you will receive a cash refund equal to (1) the current value of your investment and (2) the total sales and creation charge you paid. The current value of your shares may be more or less than your original investment\n18-Month Cancellation Right. You are also able cancel the plan within 18 months after your first investment in the plan. If you choose to cancel your plan after the 45-day cancellation period, you will receive a cash refund equal to (1) the current value of your investment and (2) the amount of the sales and creation charge you paid that exceeds 15 percent of the total investments you've made in the plan. You should receive a notice of your 18-month cancellation right if you miss (1) three or more of your monthly investment payments during the first 15 months of the plan or (2) one or more payments after the first 15 months.\nIf you cancel your plan after 18 months, you will not be entitled to a refund of any creation and sales charge. This charge can be up to 50 percent of your periodic investments.",
