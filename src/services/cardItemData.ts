Financial expert Ramit Sethi explains our relationship with money is just as personal and valuable as any other relationship in our life. Here are some ways to build a healthier relationship with money. First, know that it’s okay to feel emotional about money. Use them to understand your values, your fears, your needs, and your wants. Then, start educating yourself about money. Understand what terms like credit, loan, compound interest, etc. mean. Often, the fear of money comes from a lack of knowledge or awareness about it. Finally, be inspired by money. Instead of focusing on what you don’t have, think about what money can buy. Don’t just focus on the materialistic aspects but also the experiences it affords you.",

    title: "WTF is The Blockchain?",
    text: "Unless you’re hiding under the rock, I am sure you’d have heard of Bitcoins and Blockchain. After all, they are the trending and media’s favorite topics these days — the buzzwords of the year. Even the people who’ve never mined a cryptocurrency or understand how it works, are talking about it. I have more non-technical friends than technical ones. They have been bugging me for weeks to explain this new buzzword to them. I guess there are thousands out there who feel the same. And when that happens, there comes a time to write something to which everyone can point the other lost souls to — that’s the purpose of this post — written in plain english that any regular internet user understands.",

    title: "Making Sense of 'Cryptoeconomics'",
    text: "The term “cryptoeconomics” causes a lot of confusion. People are often unclear on what it is supposed to mean. The word itself can be misleading, as it suggests that there is a parallel “crypto” version of the whole of economics. This is wrong, and Parker is right to mock such a generalization. In simple terms, cryptoeconomics is the use of incentives and cryptography to design new kinds of systems, applications, and networks.",
